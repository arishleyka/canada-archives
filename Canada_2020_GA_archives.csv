That is why Canada is committed to meeting the basic needs of the poorest and most vulnerable among this population.The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today announced Canada’s continued support of up to $90 million over 3 years for Palestinian refugees through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This support will help respond to the rising needs of vulnerable Palestinian refugees in UNRWA’s 5 areas of operation (the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan).This commitment will contribute to meeting the basic education, health and livelihood needs of Palestinian refugees, especially women and children. It will also provide emergency lifesaving assistance to an estimated 465,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria and Lebanon, through UNRWA’s Emergency Appeal for the Syria regional crisis. In addition, it will complement UNRWA’s response to the new and emerging needs created by the COVID19 pandemic.Canada’s funding will also reinforce UNRWA’s ongoing efforts to uphold UN values and humanitarian principles, including neutrality, within the agency and its operations. These efforts are essential to the effective delivery of its work and to Canada’s continued support.Canada exercises enhanced due diligence for all humanitarian and development assistance funding for Palestinians. This work includes ongoing oversight, regular site visits, a systematic screening process and strong antiterrorism provisions in funding agreements."
1,Backgrounder - Canada’s support for Palestinian refugees,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/12/backgrounder---canadas-support-for-palestinian-refugees.html,12/21/20,2020, backgrounders,"Canada has announced funding of up to $90 million over 3 years for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).In the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, UNRWA’s core programs provide basic education, health, social services and livelihood opportunities and help to protect the rights of Palestinian refugees, in line with the agency’s mandate. By helping to meet the basic needs of Palestinian refugees, UNRWA’s services contribute to stability in the region.In response to the Syria regional crisis, UNRWA focuses on preserving the resilience of vulnerable individuals by providing humanitarian assistance and a protective framework for Palestinian refugees in the form of basic services, such as education, health, water, sanitation and hygiene and livelihood activities.This continued commitment builds on Canada’s previous support for Palestinian refugees. From 2016 though 2019, Canada committed a total of $110 million in support for UNRWA. In addition, as part of new funding to respond to COVID19 announced by the Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, in April 2020, Canada provided $1.5 million to UNRWA to support the agency’s preparedness and response to COVID19 in the region.Providing basic education, health and social services to Palestinian refugees  up to $75 million over 3 yearsThis funding will help over half a million Palestinian refugee girls and boys receive quality basic education, which is a top priority for UNRWA, given that approximately half of its core budget is spent on education services. Canada’s funding will also help to operate more than 140 primary healthcare clinics and support outreach teams in delivering access to healthcare services, medications and immunizations to approximately 3.5 million individuals. In addition, it will contribute to providing basic shelter and food for the poorest Palestinian refugees.Through this funding, Canada is also continuing its support for UNRWA’s ongoing efforts to promote neutrality in its operations and among its staff, the majority of whom are also Palestinian refugees. This assistance builds on previous Canadian support and demonstrates how Canada and UNRWA are working together to reinforce respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, operational independence and impartiality. This is essential to the effective delivery of the agency’s work and to Canada’s continued support.Humanitarian principles, including neutrality, represent a core commitment and value of UN staff, as well as a key element of UNRWA’s regulatory framework. Canadian funding will help strengthen the agency’s transparency and accountability in this regard. Through the Framework for Cooperation between  and UNRWA, Canada has set out its requirements regarding implementing reform, regular monitoring and reporting, and compliance with Canadian antiterrorism requirements.Emergency appeal for the Syria regional crisis  up to $15 million over 3 yearsCanada’s support will provide humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of Palestinian refugees affected by the Syria regional crisis. Canadian assistance will provide food, cash and nonfood items, as well as emergency health assistance, psychosocial and protection services, and highquality and inclusive education for girls and boys. For Palestinian refugees from Syria displaced to Lebanon, Canadian assistance will also help to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihoods.UNRWA’s response to the COVID19 crisisThe COVID19 crisis is worsening preexisting vulnerabilities among Palestinian refugees, and UNRWA is adapting. The agency has adjusted the delivery of its education and health services to protect the communities it serves and to limit the spread of COVID19. UNRWA has managed to maintain its services and prevent outbreaks of COVID19 within densely populated Palestinian refugee camps, although the risk of outbreaks remains a concern. The agency has shifted to telemedicine and home delivery of essential medications and food, distributed hygiene packs and food parcels to those in quarantine, set up health advice hotlines and maintained an educationinemergencies program to support homeschooling and remote learning.UN Office of Internal Oversight Services InvestigationCanadian officials have reviewed the confidential investigation report prepared by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services regarding allegations of misconduct among former UNRWA senior managers. The report supports the UN's earlier confirmations that no fraud or misappropriation of operational funds occurred. UNRWA’s new senior management has committed to significant management reform initiatives aimed at strengthening UNRWA’s accountability, transparency, management and governance. Canada will remain engaged on these efforts."

Meanwhile, new credible information has come to light from human rights organizations about further grave human rights violations and abuses in Chechnya, including an alarming increase in the number of abductions and enforced disappearances.“In the two years since the report was released, the inaction by Russia has further contributed to a climate of impunity for human rights abusers. Canada again urges Russia to conduct an impartial and credible investigation so that those responsible for torture and other abuses are held to account. Canada continues to call on Russia to take heed of the report’s recommendations and to respect the dignity and human rights of all individuals without discrimination. Human rights have no borders. Canada believes human rights are universal and indivisible, and these include the human rights of LGBTQ2 people.”“As a strong, vocal and forceful advocate for universal human rights for all, the Government of Canada is committed to combatting discrimination, violence, and unjust laws targeting the LGBTQ2 community around the world.”Associated links Human rights violations in Chechnya to be investigatedExpert report confirms human rights abuses in ChechnyaJoint statement delivered by Permanent Representative of France to the OSCE Véronique RogerLacan on the Moscow Mechanism invoked by 16 participating states"

This abuse can occur in many forms, from intimate partner violence to rape, trafficking, female genital mutilation or cutting and child, early and forced marriage. Sadly, most survivors do not feel comfortable coming forward because of outdated stigmas, complex legal systems and the pain of reliving the events.“Sexual and genderbased violence does not occur in a vacuum: we know that further risks and stigmatization affect women and girls who are Indigenous, racialized, lesbian, bisexual, trans, queer, or twospirit, living with disabilities, or experiencing homelessness. We also know that COVID19 mitigation measures, especially stayathome orders, have contributed to increased abuse and disruptions in accessing support.“Not only do these survivors bear the lifelong effects of their perpetrator’s actions, but sexual and genderbased violence affects entire communities as barriers to peace, security and prosperity.“This is why Canada takes a feminist approach to our foreign policy and international assistance. This drives our multilateral engagement, including on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It has been 25 years since the Beijing Declaration stated ‘women’s rights are human rights.’ We call for continued progress, including addressing new forms of abuse, such as violence against women and girls in the digital sphere.  “Canada is inspired by efforts of those on the front lines of the fight against sexual and genderbased violence and their continued resilience, particularly during the current COVID19 pandemic. We continue to support women’s rights organizations, human rights defenders, and the media in confronting abuse. Institutionally, we also support increased recruitment and training of women in policing and security roles to make it easier for survivors to report their abuse safely. Canada champions the integration and early adoption of prevention, mitigation and response measures for sexual and genderbased violence throughout every stage of humanitarian interventions.“As Canada marks the beginning of 16 Days of Activism Against GenderBased Violence, concluding on Human Rights Day, December 10, we invite you to join the conversation using the hashtag #16Days and to become an ally by listening, believing, speaking out, intervening and acting.”"

The COVID19 pandemic has aggravated already difficult conditions, crippling an economy that had been steadily growing and overburdening already stretched health resources.The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today announced that the Government of Canada is pledging $270 million over the next 3 years (2021 to 2024) in bilateral development assistance to Afghanistan.Minister Gould made the announcement at the 2020 Afghanistan Conference, a virtual ministerial pledging conference cohosted by the Government of Afghanistan, the Government of Finland and the United Nations.Canada’s contribution, and the Afghanistan Conference, comes at a critical point in Afghanistan’s history, as peace talks offer the Afghan people the possibility of peace for the first time in a generation.The renewed funding includes a contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, as well as support for projects in priority areas such as health and education; women’s empowerment; human rights; and women, peace and security.Today’s pledge also fulfills Canada’s commitment to support Afghanistan’s plan for selfreliance, the Transformation Decade (2015 to 2024)."

We remain confident that a negotiated settlement is not only possible, but in the interests of both our countries.”Quick FactsThe new duty rate that will apply to exports from most companies subject to the first administrative review is 8.99%, compared to the current rate of 20.23%. Certain companies will also receive companyspecific rates.The new rates will apply on a going forward basis to softwood lumber exports to the United States from companies that were subject to the first Administrative Review.Once any challenges before CUSMA Chapter 10 or U.S. courts have been resolved, these new duty rates will apply retroactively to softwood lumber exports to the U.S. from companies that were subject to the first Administrative Review.Associated linksFrequently asked questions – Softwood lumber"
41,Remarks by the Minister of Foreign Affairs before the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/11/remarks-by-the-minister-of-foreign-affairs-before-the-special-committee-on-canada-china-relations.html,11/24/20,2020, speeches,"Pacific region are a driver of economic prosperity for Canada and for the world. By some estimates, just ten years from now, Asia will account for roughly 60% of the world’s economic growth.The bilateral and multilateral relationships we foster and the region’s stability create jobs, open up markets, connect communities and support Canadian families here at home.As the world’s second largest economy and home to 1.4 billion people, China is a key actor in the region and beyond.Why China mattersThis year marks 50 years of diplomatic relations between Canada and China.50 years later, I don’t think anyone would say this is an easy relationship. Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have now been arbitrarily detained for nearly two years.It is a complex and multidimensional one, not just for Canada, but for democracies around the world.China is changing before our eyes and at a rapid pace.We recognize China’s growing influence on the world stage, as a global hub for manufacturing, trade and lending … and the single largest trading nation in the world.It is the first trading partner of an astonishing 124 countries. It is the first trading partner in Africa, second in Latin America. And it is also an important trading partner for Canada for both imports and exports. Bilateral trade in goods and services between Canada and China increased eightfold over the last 20 years, from $10.6 billion in 2000 to $82.8 billion in 2019.In addition, China can be a key player on the world stage in the fight against climate change, COVID19, or to ensure the stability of financial markets and global economic development.With significant development assistance funding in Africa and Latin America, it gives China growing clout in the developing world.As an example, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, China has signed cooperation agreements with 138 countries to build infrastructure that will connect it to developing countries. China’s banks have already provided loans worth over US $461 billion, raising many concerns over debt sustainability, transparency and international standards on labour and the environment.China’s ambition even reaches the Arctic region where it aims to develop shipping lanes, calling it the Polar Silk Road. This is a new reality we need to take into account and thus engage China with eyes wide open.The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015, or even the China of 2018.Its rise has brought with it troubling threats to human rights, to longstanding agreements of autonomy for places like Hong Kong, to freedom of expression, and to the international institutions that underpin the rulesbased order of which Canada is a steadfast promoter. We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.This includes the use of coercive diplomacy, like the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor to try to get their way.This, however, is not a sentiment unique to me or to Canada. Democracies around the world are rethinking their own relationship with China.Multilateralism will be key to ensuring global stability and security in a world in which China is a powerful actor. That’s why we are working with likeminded countries to defend the rulesbased international order and ensure China abides by its obligations under international human rights law.When dealing with China, we will be firmly guided by Canadian interests, our fundamental values and principles, including human rights, as well as global rules and strategic partnerships.Let me be clear, the safety and security of Canadians at home and abroad will always be at the heart of our approach.Tactics such as coercive diplomacy, including arbitrary detention, are unacceptable in the conduct of statetostate relations and this is something I have raised not just with our allies but directly with my Chinese counterpart.We do and we will continue to challenge China when it comes to human rights being violated and will always protect Canadians when it comes to our national security, compete with our innovative businesses and abundant resources that allow us to do so, and cooperate on global challenges like climate change because there is no easy path forward without China.How we engage – evolution & Canada’s actions in the past yearMICHAEL KOVRIG and MICHAEL SPAVORMore than 700 days have passed since the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, as well as the arbitrary sentencing of Mr. Schellenberg, and we remain deeply concerned.We continue to call for the immediate release of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, and for clemency for Mr. Schellenberg, as we do for all Canadians facing the death penalty.I know all members of this committee, indeed all Canadians, are angered by the detention of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor and are concerned for their wellbeing. I would also like to acknowledge the resilience demonstrated by the families and their support every step of the way.Finally, after many months, we recently secured onsite virtual consular access to Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor. This is something I had personally raised in a meeting with my counterpart State Councilor Wang Yi in Rome in August this year and on which we worked tirelessly.Since October, Ambassador Barton has on two occasions travelled to the prisons in which they are being held to lead onsite virtual visits to personally confirm the health and wellbeing of these two Canadians while they remain unjustly detained.This is a very important development and we continue to work very hard to secure their release.HONG KONGTurning to Hong Kong, the imposition of the new National Security Law in Hong Kong has raised significant concerns about:The future of Hong Kong’s independent judiciary;The future of human rights and freedoms in the Special Administrative Region;The integrity of the One Country, Two Systems framework; And Hong Kong’s role as global hub.On November 11, we condemned China’s removal of four democratically elected lawmakers from office in Hong Kong. It is an assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms under the SinoBritish Joint Declaration.Alongside our partners, we continue to call on Chinese authorities to uphold international human rights obligations.We have been at the forefront of the international response to the National Security Law, issuing – often at our urging – statements alongside Australia, the UK, the United States, the G7, the Five Eyes, at the Human Rights Council, and most recently at the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee.We were also the first to suspend our extradition treaty with Hong Kong and have announced a series of other measures including export control measures and an update on travel advice for the region.Last week, you heard from my colleague Minister Mendicino on the immigration measures we have put in place. Our response to both Hong Kong and to China is one that crosses many departments and requires significant coordination.XINJIANGAs all of you I’m sure, I have been quite alarmed by the reports of gross human rights violations in Xinjiang. The violations target Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.Publicly and privately, in multilateral and bilateral dialogues, we have called on the Chinese government to end the repression in Xinjiang.I have raised this directly with my Chinese counterpart, most recently in Rome this summer at a meeting which was called at my request.In September, we raised concerns about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and in October, we were one of 39 countries signing the Third Committee’s declaration at UNGA in New York which referenced Xinjiang.We continue to call on the Chinese government to allow unfettered, meaningful access to Xinjiang to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Procedures.This is something I have raised directly with Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. CONCLUSIONOur relationship with China is a complex one indeed.It is absolutely imperative that democracies like Canada and our likeminded partners work together to protect the international rules that have ensured stability and prosperity for decades. It is a challenge we all share. No country will succeed alone.Our Principled Strategic Approach to China goes well beyond our bilateral relationship; it is a global challenge. This is why we have been working with partners, especially when it comes to areas of fundamental disagreements with China.Now I know some like to talk tough on China.To those who are seduced by this onedimensional view I say this:While it is easy to be tough, let’s continue to be smart.Let’s not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible results for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.I think Canadians know this. They know we must be smart in our approach, and we must be nimble.That is what is at stake here.I want to thank you for your time and for the role you as a committee are playing in shaping the CanadaChina relationship and informing the Canadian public about China.And as we discuss today, I invite you to take a broader and longer view of the CanadaChina relationship.I am here to hear your ideas and engage in a constructive dialogue with you about one of the most important geostrategic issues of our time.It is a feature of an open and successful country that we have these discussions.With that, I’m happy to take your questions."

Today, members of the Ottawa Group took important steps toward a proposed WTO Trade and Health Initiative, which identifies shortterm actions to streghten supply chains and ensure the free flow of medicines and medical supplies.Canada remains committed to leading the charge on broader WTO reform with the Ottawa Group, where ministers today had a productive discussion on efforts to modernize the WTO. They agreed to continue intensifying work on ecommerce and fisheries negotiations, as well as keeping agrifood markets open and predictable. Ministers also noted the importance of deepening discussions on trade and environmental sustainability at the WTO.Ottawa Group members also discussed the Singaporeled proposal to prohibit the use of export restrictions on food purchased for noncommercial humanitarian purposes by the World Food Programme to ensure food security for the world’s most vulnerable people. Ottawa Group members agreed to encourage the adoption of this proposal by the wider WTO membership at the upcoming December General Council meeting.Canada will continue to take a leadership role in modernizing the WTO so that Canadian businesses and workers alike benefit from global trade."

This will provide a competitive edge to Canadian exporters and businesses who will maintain preferential access to the United Kingdom market, even as the country exits the EU.This agreement will provide stability and predictability for businesses, exporters, and workers in both Canada and the United Kingdom. It will also maintain Canada's high standards for businesses, workers, and the environment while ensuring the continuity and efficiency of the country’s supplymanaged products system.Canada and the United Kingdom have long shared a profound and positive relationship, with a long history of working closely together. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with the United Kingdom to further enhance the bilateral trade relationship, including through a mutual commitment to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement that can be best tailored to the bilateral relationship and interests. The government looks forward to consulting with Canadians and the provinces and territories, before going back to the negotiating table with the United Kingdom and will always prioritize the needs of Canadian workers and businesses.Canada is committed to continued strong and stable trading relationships with both the United Kingdom and the EU to support our shared economic prosperity."
44,Statement on World Children’s Day,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/11/statement-on-world-childrens-day.html,11/20/20,2020, statements," The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today issued the following statement:“On World Children’s Day, Canada commits to taking action to improve the lives of children so that they can thrive and achieve their dreams and potential. The challenges are considerable. Worldwide, COVID19 has disrupted the lives of 9 out of 10 learners. Almost 200 million of them are children, including adolescents and youths, living in countries facing humanitarian crises.“Canada’s focus is on reaching the world’s most vulnerable and marginalized children, including refugees, forcibly displaced children, and children in host communities. Without school feeding programs, these children face food insecurity. Without school, they are missing out on a safe place to grow and thrive. For the most vulnerable children, school provides safety, access to vital nutrition and health services and the opportunity of a brighter future.“Refugee and other forcibly displaced children are disproportionately harmed by the COVID19 pandemic. When schools are closed, girls and adolescent girls are at greater risk of genderbased violence and child, early and forced marriage. The United Nations estimates that there will be 13 million additional cases due to COVID19 alone of child, early and forced marriage over the next few years, with at least 4 million of these marriages happening in the next 2 years. Many of these marriages could be prevented if girls were in school.“Every child deserves a quality education in an environment that is safe and inclusive—even in the midst of a pandemic. We know the value each child and young person brings to a society and we know the potential that can be unlocked through education. Every child deserves that chance. The transformative power of education opens doors to better health, wellbeing and opportunity. These doors must be open to all.”"

46,Media Freedom Coalition ministerial communiqué,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/11/media-freedom-coalition-ministerial-communique.html,11/16/20,2020, statements,"We, the members of the Media Freedom Coalition, held our first ministeriallevel meeting on November 16, 2020, to exchange views and coordinate action in the defence of media freedom worldwide. The ministerial meeting took place as part of the second Global Conference for Media Freedom, cohosted by Canada and Botswana.The Media Freedom Coalition is a partnership of countries working together to advocate for and support media freedom, online as well as offline, and the safety of journalists and media workers. The Coalition aims to promote accountability for those who harm journalists and media workers or unduly restrict them from doing their job.All members have signed the Global Pledge on Media Freedom. As signatories, each member has made the commitment to work together to improve media freedom and the safety of journalists both at home and abroad.We recalled that attacks on media freedom are also attacks on human rights, including the right to freedom of expression enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.We underlined that media freedom is essential to the protection of human rights by making the facts about human rights violations and abuses public.We further affirmed that a free media is the cornerstone of democracy. People need free and independent media to provide them with accurate information, facilitate informed public debate and discussion, hold governments accountable, and serve as a watchdog for the public interest.We underlined the link between media freedom and economic development and prosperity, including the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.We expressed alarm at the continued decline in media freedom driven in part by the rise of authoritarianism and the use of digital technologies to restrict media freedom. This has resulted in, inter alia, unduly restrictive laws, arbitrary and/or unlawful surveillance, censorship, undue interference in the circulation of information online, and physical violence, exacerbated by financial threats to media independence and sustainability.We commended the crucial role played by journalists and media workers and paid tribute to those who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession.Media Freedom Coalition ministers met in the midst of the unprecedented COVID19 pandemic, which is affecting all parts of the world, imposing a tremendous cost on societies, exacerbating preexisting vulnerabilities, causing societal changes, and further undermining media freedom.We commended journalists and other media workers, including those reporting on this health crisis. Their work serves to keep societies informed, to promote proper health measures, and to counter false or misleading information.We expressed concern at the efforts of some states to use the crisis as an excuse to put in place undue restrictions on a free and independent media. We also expressed concern that some states have undertaken pandemicrelated disinformation campaigns to undermine trust in democratic political systems and their pandemic responses.We urged governments to continue guaranteeing the freedom and independence of the media and the safety of journalists and other media professionals, as well as to refrain from imposing undue restrictions in the fight against COVID19.We recognized the worrying growth of threats against journalists, both online and offline, that attempt to intimidate journalists and media organizations into silence.We condemned unequivocally all attacks and violence against journalists and media workers, such as torture, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary detention, as well as intimidation and harassment in both conflict and nonconflict situations.We urged governments to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work without undue interference, including interference by means of legislative measures, unlawful or arbitrary surveillance, enforcement of excessive libel laws, and other measures that prevent journalists from carrying out their work.We recognized that impunity for attacks against journalists constitutes one of the main challenges to strengthening the protection of journalists.We called upon governments to do their utmost to prevent violence against journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability through the conduct of investigations into alleged violence against journalists within their jurisdictions, to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice, and to ensure that victims have access to appropriate remedies.We underlined that human rights, including those involving media freedom, must be protected online just as they are protected offline and acknowledged the transformative role of digital technologies in supporting access to and the dissemination of information and ideas.We reaffirmed the responsibilities of intermediaries, such as social media platforms and search engines, to respect human rights and defend media freedom, given their effects on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.We expressed concern regarding measures taken by intermediaries to limit access to or remove content online, including through automated processes, such as algorithms, which have not been made transparent and the use of which may unduly restrict access to information.We expressed profound concern about and condemned the growing trend of intentional, governmentimposed Internet shutdowns, as well as targeted content filtration and removal. Governmentimposed network restrictions, whether partial or complete, limit media freedom and the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to report on human rights violations or abuses and hold governments accountable.We acknowledged the profound impact the use of artificial intelligence may have on media freedom, including the potential for enhanced capacity for largescale unlawful and/or arbitrary surveillance of journalists and censorship of the media, and the algorithmic curation of news without transparency or accountability.We expressed concern at laws, punitive legal measures and physical violence that have restricted journalists’ and media organizations’ vital work, often under the guise of addressing disinformation.We expressed profound concern about the chilling effect on media freedom of the proliferation of overly broad “fake news” laws and the rise in arrests and detentions of journalists on the charge of “fake news.”We expressed concern about the erosion of public trust, due to the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation, interfering with the public’s need to access information of public interest and value for democratic participation.We stressed the need for potential solutions to disinformation to be rooted in respect for human rights, freedom of expression, and democracy.We commended initiatives by civil society to tackle the issue of access to reliable information during infodemics, and we called on intermediaries, including social media platforms, to be part of global efforts to protect media freedom while respecting the key principles of transparency and respecting human rights.On the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, we recognized the imperative to undertake a genderresponsive approach to the protection and promotion of media freedom and recalled the important role media plays in shaping the public’s perception of women in society and the media’s role in the advancement of gender equality.We acknowledged the genderspecific risks faced by women journalists in the exercise of their work, including sexual and genderbased violence, harassment, online and offline attacks, stalking, and intimidation.We underlined that the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, intimidation, and violence against women journalists have a broader negative effect on gender equality and women’s rights and empowerment by silencing the voices of women, including their experiences and concerns.A healthy information ecosystem depends on a free, independent, plural, accessible, and diverse media. This includes diversity of representation, with different lived experiences within media organizations themselves, acknowledging the importance of intersectionality in promoting inclusion and respect for diversity.We therefore recognized the importance of representation in the media of groups that have often themselves been the subject of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and other human rights violations and abuses, including members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities; persons with disabilities; and lesbian, gay bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons.We acknowledged the additional risks faced by journalists based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.We recognized the unprecedented economic challenges facing media due to a significant decline in advertisement revenue and the farreaching effects of the COVID19 pandemic.We expressed concern that these challenges may significantly affect the health of the global information ecosystem by reducing the diversity of views disseminated to the public and putting at risk the independence of the press, with potentially corrosive effects on democratic governance. We welcomed the launch of a new working group to address the issue of media sustainability by the Forum on Information and Democracy.Ministers discussed a range of policy options and best practices to strengthen media freedom worldwide.We called on members of the Media Freedom Coalition to consider:providing safe refuge for journalists at risk who have been targeted for their workincreasing coordination and investment in media development spending to support media independence, accessibility, and sustainabilityproviding consistent and longterm support for building robust collaborative national efforts addressing the safety of journalists and the issue of impunityengaging in concerted advocacy as a vocal group committed to defending media freedomstrengthening measures to foster an enabling legal environment for freedom of expression, including for members of the mediaseeking greater inclusion of the issue of the safety of journalists in the processes of the relevant UN and regional human rights bodiesimplementing genderresponsive measures to protecting the safety of journalists that recognize and address the genderspecific risks faced by women and intersecting marginalized groups, including racial, ethnic and religious minorities, persons with disabilities, and persons in vulnerable situations, including LGBTI personsadopting and applying targeted sanctions against known perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses in response to the repression of journalists and restrictions on media freedomcondemning all attacks against journalists and countering the increasing stigmatization and denigration of journalists by public officialsworking with digital intermediaries, such as social media platforms, to promote preventative measures against the misuse of their products in ways that unduly restrict media freedomexploring best practices to tackle the rise of infodemics and reflecting upon the proposals made by the group of experts from the Forum on Information and DemocracyWe underscored the important role played by international and regional organizations in the protection and promotion of media freedom, including the UN, UNESCO, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of American States, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the Council of Europe.We welcomed Belize and Botswana as the newest members of the Media Freedom Coalition, expanding the ranks of those countries supporting the objectives of media freedom.We welcomed the ongoing work of the independent High Level Panel of Legal Experts on Media Freedom to provide advice to governments to prevent and reverse repression of media freedom.We noted with appreciation the recommendations contained in the initial reports of the High Level Legal Panel on the use of targeted sanctions to protect journalists and on consular assistance.We look forward to the publication of subsequent reports for our consideration ahead of the next ministeriallevel meeting of the Media Freedom Coalition.We commended the work of the civil society Advisory Network of the Media Freedom Coalition in providing expert counsel and in identifying cases of concern to be addressed through diplomatic intervention.We committed to strengthen the working methods of the Coalition to be more responsive to cases of concern identified by the Advisory Network and other members of the Coalition.We welcomed the progress made by UNESCO in supporting initiatives through the Global Media Defence Fund, including for grassroots organizations around the world.We welcomed the contributions of new donors to this fund, which will expand the reach and sustainability of the fund.We look forward to the next ministerial meeting of the Media Freedom Coalition, in Estonia in 2021, to renew commitments and to discuss emerging threats and opportunities.We look forward to the World Press Freedom Conference, on December 9 and 10, 2020, in The Hague, organized by the Netherlands and UNESCO.Afghanistan, Argentina, Austria, Botswana, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Honduras, Iceland, Japan, Kosovo, Latvia, Lebanon*, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Sudan, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, the United States*Lebanon aligns itself with the statement, with reservations.Ottawa November 16, 2020"

92,Address by Minister Gould to Canadian International Council,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/11/address-by-minister-gould-to-canadian-international-council.html,11/13/20,2020, speeches,"affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”In the past year, COVID19 has, obviously, dominated the agenda. However, its emergence did not put an end to the other humanitarian crises we face in Venezuela or Yemen, did not put an end to the suffering of the Rohingya and did not make Ebola disappear. Over the past decade, we have seen the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance climb from 69 million to over 250 million today. All these issues and all the people affected by these crises already needed our help, and COVID19 only served to compound the challenges they face and make the lives of these millions of vulnerable people even more difficult. It has only increased the strain on a global humanitarian system.In the citation for the World Food Programme, the Norwegian Nobel Committee also wrote that “the need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever.” I could not agree more, though I realize there are some who disagree, who see this year as a clear indication that Canada should back away from its multilateral commitments and take a more muscular, selfinterested approach to the world.As minister of international development, I profoundly disagree with both this approach and the claim that Canada will be better off if we go it alone. Where I think we need to be more clear is in why we believe that multilateralism is the right approach. It is not an end in and of itself. Multilateralism for the sake of multilateralism is not the objective. It is how we use that system to shape a world that is better able to confront the collective challenges we, as Canadians but also as world citizens, all face.In the years after the Second World War, the framers of the current international order grappled with how to prevent the world from having to face the same horrors they had just overcome—twice. To that end they built a system that constrained the ambitions of the great powers, that enshrined the sanctity of state sovereignty and that fostered economic linkages that would make war unfeasible. The current system has, for example, ushered in an era of peace between large powers not seen since the Congress of Vienna; it has delivered a network of economic relationships that have driven poverty down across the world, and it built a foundation for better health outcomes for people everywhere. What is more, Canada has been a prime beneficiary of this system. However, the challenges we face today are different. Whereas their goal was fundamentally preventative, our goal must be proactive.We must continually seek to renew and strengthen the current rulesbased system and to reform specific multilateral institutions so that they can address the challenges of today and tomorrow. Important elements of the current system are under strain and often too slow in addressing intrastate and collective action problems on a global scale. We are seeing more intrastate conflicts and more people displaced than ever before. We are seeing the rules that govern the treatment of those people come under a sustained attack and a growing number of states deciding the rules no longer apply. We are seeing attempts to roll back progress that has been made on gender equality and women’s rights and seeing environmental degradation and climate change become epochdefining threats to our collective existence.In the face of these and other challenges, it is all too tempting to throw up our hands and say sauve qui peut [save yourself if you can], to ask, “What is the point of pursuing Pearsonian diplomacy?” Yet it is precisely now that we should be reminding ourselves of what Pearsonian diplomacy is all about. For Pearson, national selfinterest and internationalism were 2 sides of the same coin. Because a world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more sustainable is ultimately one that is better for Canada. He would often ask that when we ask ourselves, “What kind of Canada do we want?” we also ask ourselves, “What kind of world do we want?”In our response to COVID19, we have the answer. In trying to respond to a collective action problem, over 180 countries have come together to ensure that we prioritize vaccinations amongst the world’s most vulnerable through the ACT [Access to COVID19 Tools]Accelerator and its COVAX [COVID19 Vaccines Global Access] Facility. Likewise, Canadian efforts to encourage multilateral solutions to the economic recovery are necessary to support developing countries struggling with the implications of the pandemic. Neither effort is perfect, but they are better than going it alone, because the alternative is a much riskier, much more dangerous, much bleaker and much lonelier road to travel.Earlier this year I had the opportunity to speak with Mary Robinson. And in reflecting on the lessons COVID19 can teach us, she summed up what I believe we must take away from this experience: that governance matters, that science matters, that compassion matters, that collective action matters and that when individuals change their behaviour they can shape outcomes for a coordinated effect. This has been true across the world, as we have seen how different countries have been able to manage—or not—the COVID19 outbreak within their borders.It is this concept of working for the people of the world that is capturing my imagination right now. The challenges we face today are collective threats to humanity: climate change, health, inequality. If nothing else, COVID19 has shown that no matter how much we may try to insulate ourselves from the world, we are intimately and intricately connected. To meet these collective challenges, I believe we are going to require coordinated multilateral action.It is against this backdrop that I want to share with you my priorities for Canada’s international development over the next decade, as we drive toward advancing the Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs]. I truly believe that we have a real opportunity to reshape the international order to better address issues demanding collective action for the benefit of Canadians and the world’s most vulnerable people.First, we will remain committed to our feminist approach. While this isn’t new, it is fundamental, and as I’ve discovered in many of the conversations I’ve had over the past 9 months, it is apparently revolutionary to stay the course. So perhaps I can explain why I think doggedly pursuing the full implementation of the Feminist International Assistance Policy is so significant.At the most basic level, the Feminist International Assistance Policy is significant because it changes the way Canada makes decisions about its international development assistance. It places the issue of gender equality at the centre of Canada’s thinking by committing 15% of our development assistance to projects that are focused on advancing equality. By doing this, we are changing the systems that discriminate against half the population, and it is by changing these entrenched structures that we will achieve greater peace, security and prosperity.However, it isn’t just about gender equality. Yes, that’s an important part, but it goes beyond that. Our feminist approach means that we must identify, address and transform power dynamics. It means taking an intersectional, human rightsbased approach. It means concerted and intentional antiracist action in our programming and processes. It means seeking out the most vulnerable and most marginalized and supporting their voices.Second, we will carry forward Canada’s longstanding commitment to, and leadership in, global health and continue to build and support an architecture that delivers for everyone. This means driving our achievements all the way to that last mile.In the context of COVID19, this means addressing the pandemic as directly as possible by ensuring that there is equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. That is why Canada is playing a leadership role in the ACTAccelerator and the COVAX Facility. We have contributed $120 million to the ACTAccelerator and $440 million to COVAX, the latter split equally between its selffinancing mechanism and its advanced market commitment.And it’s worth noting that the COVAX Facility now represents the largest multilateral collaboration since the Paris Climate Accord. There are 186 participants, representing over 85% of the global population and including 94 selffinancing participants. This is an example of not only how multilateralism can work but why it matters in the face of global challenges like a pandemic.However, despite the accomplishment that the mere establishment of these mechanisms represents, we remain at a critical juncture in the area of global health, as systems around the world are under incredible and growing pressure and the weaknesses in existing systems are being revealed. We can clearly see, as a result of COVID19, the terrible effects not having access to health care can have, so we need to commit ourselves to working toward achieving universal access. We can already see the devastating impacts of the numerous lifesaving interventions that have been halted or delayed because of COVID19. Immunization campaigns, nutrition interventions and community approaches to health care have been tested and refined in recent decades and save millions of lives. It is unconscionable to think that we are losing ground across so many fronts, especially as we enter the UN Decade of Delivery for the SDGs.As I said earlier, the fundamental challenge of COVID19 in the developing world is that it is compounding and exacerbating almost every single other health challenge, often in sharply different ways. Additionally, over the course of this pandemic, we have seen just how closely health care and human rights are interconnected. We have seen how some have chosen to exploit this moment to roll back essential health care services in the name of COVID19 management. Lockdowns may be containing the spread, yet they are also leading to disturbing spikes in sexual and genderbased violence, as well as in violence against and exploitation of children and youth. This is why I have also paid particular attention to continuity of education and working with partner countries to safely reopen schools when it is possible. Schools often represent safe places for girls and boys. We know how vital education is to their current and future wellbeing.Additionally, millions of women and girls around the world are now facing acute challenges to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is compounded by medical supply chains being redirected in support of personal protective equipment and testing but often at the cost of other essential services and supplies, such as family planning, access to contraception and access to safe and legal abortion, as well as to postabortion care. As we move forward, we must continue to work toward truly integrating sexual and reproductive health and rights, including in emergencies, into health systems around the world.Driving our results forward also means shining a spotlight on those SDGs that have not received the same kind of attention that others have. SDG2 is an example of this. We know that, as a result of the pandemic, the number of foodinsecure people (690 million people in 2020) may rise by as much as 130 million by the end of 2020. According to the World Food Programme, if current trends continue, the number of hungry people will reach 840 million by 2030. Malnutrition will likely also exacerbate the COVID19 impacts on mothers and children. We have seen how fragile food systems and supply chains truly are and the devastating effects that can have. We will do more to help end chronic malnutrition.Third, we will do our part to tackle climate change. Though COVID19 has rocked the world, its effects—while undeniably terrible—pale in comparison to the existential threat climate change represents, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable, who we know will feel its effects most acutely. I would remind us all that these are also the people who have contributed the least to the problem. This must offend our most basic sense of fairness.Our goal is nothing less than to build a world that is naturepositive and carbonneutral. This means we are going to drive more resources to leastdeveloped countries and diversify our implementing partners. It means we are going to integrate climate, nature and biodiversity thinking into our work and ensure that our programming takes an intersectional, feminist approach to fighting climate change.In part, this means doing more to help those who are already being affected by climate change. For instance, we know that changing weather patterns are placing increased strain on an already stressed food system in the form of less productive land, crops that are no longer suited to the conditions and an increased burden on those who are responsible for food production. In subSaharan Africa, 70% of the smallholder farmers who support the food system are women. For them, climate change isn’t an impending tidal wave. For them, it has already swept up the beach.We also know that as humanity encroaches on the natural world at an alarming rate, we are putting both our lives and our livelihoods at greater risk. Zoonotic diseases, like COVID19, are thought to be related to our continuous expansion into wild spaces. We need to make serious, sustained investments in sustainable agriculture, in conservation, in disaster risk mitigation measures and, of course, in clean energy.And we have started to make those investments. In 2016, Canada committed $2.65 billion to reducing greenhouse gases internationally. And we are already starting to see returns on these investments. To date, we estimate that Canada’s investments are expected to result in 176 megatons in greenhouse gas reductions. What is more, our projects are making a difference on the ground. For instance, earlier this year the Government of Canada partnered with the Caribbean Development Bank to establish the CanadaCARICOM Climate Adaptation Fund, which will help promote resilience in the region by helping to pay the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility insurance premiums for 9 countries in the region. In the current context, this will help free up fiscal space to help finance their response to COVID19 but will also help make sure they are able to rebuild after the next catastrophic hurricane season.Building on the conversations I’ve had with stakeholders here in Canada and around the world, we have learned important lessons from this first wave of programming. We know that women and farmers are on the front line of the battle to fight climate change. Ensuring our programming responds to their needs, both in terms of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and in terms of adapting to the realities of a changing climate, will be a guiding principle as we move forward. Additionally, we recognize the important role that nature plays in absorbing carbon, and I am excited about incorporating naturebased solutions into our future work. Working with local communities, Indigenous people and women’s activists will help ensure that we build lasting solutions to the climate crisis.While the world is rightly concerned with the impact of the pandemic on development gains, the impact that climate change will have is even more worrisome. We will work in partnership with and led by local communities to ensure that they not only benefit from our climate investments but also are key agents in the solution.Fourth, to achieve this, we also need to focus our efforts on shoring up democratic governance. It is becoming clear that there is a direct relationship between citizens’ trust in their governing institutions and their willingness to follow those institutions’ advice peacefully. Furthermore, transparency and accountability in the provision of health data are paramount for national governments and the world community to effectively respond to the current pandemic. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding human rights; it is in times of crisis that civil liberties, freedom of expression and a free press are most important.We know how much functioning public institutions matter to sustainable development. Canada has a lot to offer the world when it comes to cooperation on governance—on the rule of law, on tax administration and wealth redistribution and on a professional and competent public service. This is maybe not 1 of the sexier topics in international development, but it is certainly 1 of the most important. Often, governance work can have 1 of the most meaningful impacts in fostering a governance environment that creates the conditions for rights, democratic participation, economic growth and sustainable practices to flourish. Effective governance is also necessary for developing countries to attract private capital investment, which is important for enabling inclusive and sustainable economic growth.Now, listening to this, I realize it seems ambitious: health, nutrition, climate and the environment, food security, gender equality and governance. It’s definitely a lot. But what we know is, you can’t do any of these things in isolation. They are all intimately connected, so to try to address 1 without addressing the others won’t lead to success.When I think back to Mary Robinson’s lessons from our response to COVID19—governance matters, compassion matters, science matters and collective action matters—I reflect on how well each of those insights applies to each of the areas I mention above. It gives me tremendous hope for the future because it also says to me that we know what we need to do. And knowing is half the battle. Now we have to act and respond. Certainly, Canada cannot achieve this all on our own. But we can build coalitions, and we can work with existing and new partners, allies and friends the world over, through our multilateral institutions and outside them, to keep advancing our shared priorities, because our collective health, security, prosperity and, quite frankly, survival depend on it.Now, I know it can be uncomfortable within the development community to suggest that development is part of our foreign policy. Canadian foreign policy is focused on creating opportunities for Canada and Canadians to shape the world we want to live in, our development work is doing this in action. And the Feminist International Assistance Policy, grounded in feminism—grounded in inclusivity, grounded in human rights and sustainability—is an incredible achievement in building a better, more compassionate and resilient world.I think, more than anything, right now—with the twin crises of COVID19 and climate, which in many places are worsened by conflict—we all need a little hope. And the objectives and priorities we seek to advance in the world should come from the basic premise that a better world is possible. It is not naively idealistic to pursue an agenda that tries to make life healthier and more just, equitable and sustainable for people around the globe. It is grounded in the realities and the constraints we face as actors in the global system. But just because the world is a harsh place, doesn’t mean we should abandon the pursuit of trying to make it a little better. That’s why multilateralism is still relevant today. It is why Pearsonian diplomacy is still relevant today. And certainly, that is what Canada’s international assistance is all about."

This has devastating effects on families, and it is the children who suffer the most. Children must be at the heart of family justice, and mechanisms like the Hague Convention on child abduction are essential in order to assist them in these terrible situations. “Canada, along with 100 contracting states, continues to support this global effort to protect children from wrongful removal or retention and return them to their country of residence. We continue to call on the global community to join us and to ratify this important convention.  “We are committed to working with our international partners to continue to protect children and to reinforce the operation of the convention.”Quick factsThe Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty that was signed in The Hague, Netherlands, on October 25, 1980. It establishes procedures for the return of abducted children to the country where they usually reside and secures protection of custody and access rights under the laws of its contracting states.Canada was the second country to ratify the convention, in 1983, and it is now applied in over 100 contracting states. Since the convention came into effect, hundreds of children have been safely returned to Canada thanks to its mechanisms.Canadians can visit International child abduction: A guidebook for leftbehind parents online for more information on the tools available to them.Associated linksConvention on the Civil Aspects of International Child AbductionInternational child abduction: A guidebook for leftbehind parents"

Through the Feminist International Assistance Policy, Canada is working to help the poorest and those in vulnerable situations by making gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls central to our efforts. This year’s theme—Acting Together to Achieve Social and Environmental Justice for All—underlines that we cannot address poverty unless we address the inequities that are at its root.“This year, we also see how the COVID19 pandemic has exposed systemic weaknesses and gaps, resulting in economic and healthcare crises that disproportionately affect the poorest and those in vulnerable situations. Gender inequality has been exacerbated by the pandemic, threatening decades of progress for women and girls.“The COVID19 crisis is creating significant challenges for all countries to eradicate poverty and maintain their development goals. This is especially true for countries in special situations, including least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states and fragile and conflictaffected states.“Canada is doing its part around the world to help countries in their efforts to end poverty and build more resilient and inclusive societies. In September, Canada announced an additional $400 million in international development funding in 2020 and committed to increased investments in international assistance.“Canada is also playing a leadership role in the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID19 and Beyond initiative, in collaboration with the United Nations and Jamaica. This process is charting a course toward mitigating the socioeconomic and financial effects of the pandemic by enabling developing countries to access the financing they need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.“We cannot afford to lose the achievements made over the last several decades toward building a more peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, resilient and sustainable world. Now, more than ever, we need a coordinated global response to eradicate poverty, and Canada is there.”"
115,Statement on World Food Day,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/10/statement-on-world-food-day.html,10/16/20,2020, statements," The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today issued the following statement:“Over the last 4 years, global hunger has been on the rise—and COVID19 has exacerbated this trend. The COVID19 health crisis is threatening to create a ‘hunger pandemic’ that could bring another 132 million people into chronic hunger. Earlier this week, the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the World Food Programme [WFP] for ‘acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.’ The WFP is racing to reach people in 88 countries who are suffering from acute food insecurity and hunger because ‘Until the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos.’“The immediate, coordinated response from international actors to support organizations like the WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization was critical to provide emergency access to food and preserve livelihoods for the most vulnerable.“While this immediate help is vital, it is also critical to focus on rebuilding food systems for greater resilience. Now is the time to integrate nutrition needs with agricultural production goals and view climateaction objectives alongside efforts to preserve livelihoods. And when two thirds of the world’s smallholder farmers are women, it is crucial to include them in decision making and developing solutions.“COVID19 has laid bare the risks and vulnerabilities in our food system, but it is also an opportunity to do things better. We need to find and amplify new ways to increase food productivity, reduce waste, raise incomes equitably and improve health and nutrition. It is also time to reexamine how to ensure that our food system stays sustainable and supports biodiversity.“The UN Food Systems Summit in 2021 will be an important opportunity to identify specific solutions for countries, communities and companies to respond to the current crisis and to build back better for people and the planet. Canada looks forward to contributing to this summit and to building moreresilient food systems both at home and abroad.”"

Dialogue, as challenging as it was, had to prevail over ignorance and fear.  “We continue to believe in the importance of our relationship. At the same time, this anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on the foundation of our bilateral relations and the path ahead. Indeed, 50 years on, Canada takes a sober view in examining our relationship, considering the importance of mutual respect and reciprocity, adherence to rules and principles, including human rights, and achieving results that are in Canadian interests. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united. The use of coercive diplomacy causes Canada to reexamine its approach, with a focus on multilateral cooperation.“As a Pacific nation, Canada recognizes that its future is tied to peace, stability and prosperity in the region. As we build a new framework for relations with China, Canada will work with partners to hold the Chinese government accountable to its international obligations. The common future of Canada and China depends on the rule of law, respect for rights and freedoms and for people in all their diversity. At the same time, we will continue to seek dialogue and cooperation where it makes sense to do so.“The bedrock of our relations—in the beginning and as it is now—remains the people of Canada and China. Together, we share longstanding connections that took root well before the establishment of diplomatic relations. These connections and the extraordinary contributions of Canadians of Chinese origin to Canada will outlive political cycles and continue to bring diversity and depth to our relationship for decades to come.”"

They expressed concern about the increased risk of genderbased violence and harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage.“Girls are worried that school closures and disruptions in education are cutting them off from their support networks, depriving them of their education and impacting their nutrition, as well as their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Despite all this, within their communities and beyond, these girls are leading efforts toward positive social change to protect girls’ rights and achieve gender equality.“This is why we support the health and rights of women and children with funding reaching $1.4 billion a year beginning in 2023. Through Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy, we support a comprehensive, integrated approach to adolescent girls’ empowerment that includes support for education and skills development, health and nutrition, advancing gender equality and addressing barriers, including sexual and genderbased violence; child, early and forced marriage; and early pregnancy.“Since 2016, through support to the United Nations Population FundUNICEF Global Programme to End Child Marriage, almost 8 million girls 10 to 19 years old have participated in programs providing health information, life skills, economic empowerment and social protection.“Canada envisions a world where adolescent girls are valued and empowered, have control over their own lives, fully participate in decisions that affect them in their homes and societies, and contribute to and benefit from development and prosperity.“We cannot forget that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity is essential to achieving each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and promoting the human rights of every girl.”"

This speech has been translated in accordance with the Government of Canada’s official languages policy and edited for posting and distribution in accordance with its communications policy.On August 6, the United States announced its decision to reimpose unjustified and unacceptable section 232 tariffs on Canadian aluminum products. Let me be clear those tariffs were unacceptable and unjustified.Canada is not a threat to U.S national security. Canadian aluminum strengthens U.S. national security and has done so for decades through unparalleled cooperation between our 2 countries. Aluminum trade between Canada and the U.S. has long been mutually beneficial for both our countries, and tariffs would have harmed workers and industry on both sides of the border, disrupting linked supply chains that have made North American aluminum more competitive around the world.Our government stood strongly for workers and the industry by immediately announcing our intention to impose dollarfordollar countermeasures in a direct, measured and proportional response to these tariffs, following consultations with Canadian business, organizations, provincial and territorial partners and with individual Canadians.Today, the United States announced their intention to drop these tariffs on imports of Canadian aluminum retroactive to September the 1st 2020. Canada welcomes this decision. It’s a testament to the Team Canada approach as we all worked relentlessly to ensure these unjustified tariffs on Canadian aluminum were removed.I want to thank provincial governments, workers and the Canadian aluminum industry, who worked together with our government as one Team Canada to defend the interests of Canada’s critical aluminum workers and the aluminum industry. By sticking together and holding firm, we achieved the outcome that Canada wanted on behalf of hardworking Canadians in the aluminum industry.That’s why I can announce today, Canada will not be imposing reciprocal countermeasures on the United States. Let me be clear—Canada has not conceded anything. We fully retain our right to impose our countermeasures if the U.S. administration decides to reimposes its tariffs on Canadian aluminum products, and we’re prepared to do so. Canada’s motto has always been we will not escalate but we will also not back down.I have spoken to the representatives of the Canadian aluminum industry to inform them of this positive development and to assure them that Canada will always stand up for our aluminum workers and the entire industry. The last several months have been incredibly difficult for Canadians, and facing this time of great uncertainty, we have worked with countries around the world to keep people safe and to ensure our businesses are supported.At a time when our business owners and workers on both sides of the border have been facing severe economic hardship, these tariffs were the last things that they needed. Furthermore, with the new NAFTA coming into force – July 1st of last year, the fact is that we must work together to boost competitiveness in North America.Through robust new rules of origin for automobiles, the new NAFTA ensures 70% of aluminum purchased by North American automakers is produced in North America. Canada’s marketdriven aluminum industry will continue to respond to the demands of consumers and of our shared North American integrated value chain as it has in the past.Canada has always been and will remain the most stable and reliable source of aluminum supply for the United States, and now is the time to work together to advance the North American competitiveness with free trade under the new NAFTA. To the thousands of hardworking Canadians in the aluminum industry, we have your back. We will always defend you, the entire aluminum industry and Canadian interests. I will now turn to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, Chrystia Freeland. Thank you."

Internet shutdowns impact all users, especially marginalized groups and those in vulnerable situations. Shutdowns limit media freedom and the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to report on human rights violations or abuses and hold governments accountable. Shutdowns and restrictions also limit the dissemination and free flow of information, harm economic activity, contribute to social and political disorder, and negatively affect public safety.Human rights must be protected online just as they are protected offline. We call on Belarusian authorities to refrain from Internet shutdowns and blocking or filtering of services and to respect Belarus’s international human rights obligations, including under articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

It constitutes a serious threat to those men and women engaged in defending the political and civil freedoms that Russia herself has committed to guarantee.

Through Operation UNIFIER, the Canadian Armed Forces are assisting the Security Forces of Ukraine (SFU) to improve and build their capability and capacity.

228,Statement on World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/06/statement-on-world-day-to-combat-desertification-and-drought.html,6/17/20,2020, statements,"term strategies, which are supported by international cooperation. Dryland ecosystems cover more than a third of the world’s land area and are often subject to inappropriate land use and overuse, as people strive to meet the immediate food, water and energy needs of their families. We know that as land degrades, political instability, conflict and migration increase—with devastating consequences for the land and the people who live on it.This year’s theme for World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, “Food. Feed. Fibre.” appropriately links public consumption habits to land use. As populations become larger and more urban, the demand for land increases to meet the demand for food, animal feed and fibre for clothing. This leads to a decline in the viability of arable land, which is made worse by more extreme climate conditions. While the COVID19 pandemic has given people everywhere pause to reconsider their consumption habits, and humanity’s reliance on land for its wellbeing and health, we already know where there is work that needs to be done.In developing countries, desertification affects women and girls disproportionately. Even though women produce 60% to 80% of food, they do not have equal access to land ownership, or the technology and financing that could help them become more climate resilient. A remarkable 20% to 30% of land has the potential to be restored through the use of sustainable practices.To help address this, Canada is proud to provide $6 million to accelerate implementation of UNCCD’s Gender Action Plan, as announced by Prime Minister Trudeau in Senegal earlier this year. We must make sure that women’s needs, perspectives and knowledge help to shape solutions to this critical situation. And as we begin the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, we must make strengthening the resilience of the world’s food systems a key element of our efforts to reduce the impacts of drought and desertification and the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on global poverty and food insecurity."

261,"Joint statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, François-Philippe Champagne, UK Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, Australian Foreign Minister, Marise Payne, and US Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo responding to China’s proposed new security law for Hong Kong",https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/05/joint-statement-on-hong-kong--canada-us-uk-and-australia.html,5/28/20,2020, statements," “Signatories to this statement reiterate our deep concern regarding Beijing’s decision to impose a national security law in Hong Kong.“Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom. The international community has a significant and longstanding stake in Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong’s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode the autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous.“China’s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legallybinding, UNregistered SinoBritish Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people  including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.“We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.“The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing's unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect. As Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity are jeopardized by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honor China’s international obligations under the UNfiled SinoBritish Joint Declaration."""

This will require responses that draw on integrated support from partners across the humanitariandevelopmentpeace nexus and that are also inclusive, nationally led, conflictsensitive, attuned to conflict drivers and focused on prevention and resilience. Without this cooperation, the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development risk slipping further out of reach.“In this context, we reaffirm our commitment to advocating for COVID19 response efforts that advance priorities established by IDPS members in the IDPS 2019 to 2021 Peace Vision, the 2030 Agenda (notably Sustainable Development Goal 16+), the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States and the Stockholm Declaration. We reaffirm the relevance of our Peace Vision priority themes in our COVID19 response efforts to enhance national cohesion; advance gender equality and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; and support a peacepromoting private sector.“We encourage national governments to ensure that measures used to respond to COVID19 contribute to just and inclusive societies and do not hamper contributions from various actors, including youth, women peacebuilders and human rights defenders. We also reiterate the need to continue supporting the protection and expansion of civil society’s operating space in implementing measures to address the pandemic, including during lockdowns.“Recognizing that women, girls and other vulnerable groups, such as migrants, refugees and those living in poverty, will be disproportionally affected by the crisis, the global response must be gender responsive and include interventions that protect all vulnerable groups from potential violence and other effects of COVID19 responses.“In this context, we also acknowledge the need to galvanize support from the private sector to support propeace activities, as well as safeguard livelihoods and the immediate and longerterm economic effects for people affected by the crisis. Together, we will strive to protect official development assistance budgets, encourage other financial flows to support governments and communities in FCAS and invite all of our peacebuilding partners to do the same.“The COVID19 pandemic has created a global crisis, and we stress that national responses alone will be insufficient to cope with the various dimensions of its impact (political, economic, social and human capital). The IDPS, as a unique tripartite platform, has an important role to play in bringing together development partners, the g7+ Group and civil society to preserve peace. In addressing this highly complex crisis, the IDPS partnership will endeavour to mobilize diverse actors to ensure inclusive dialogue and collective engagement, and to foster SouthSouth, triangular and fragilefragile cooperation. We will work together to ensure that our peacebuilding, statebuilding and conflictprevention objectives remain at the forefront of responses to the pandemic , and together, we will continue to advance our common objective of driving positive change for those in fragile and conflictaffected situations.”"

Our trading relationship is critical in allowing both Canadians and Europeans access to the goods and services they rely on.The meeting was an opportunity to outline how the CanadaEuropean Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is an essential part of the COVID19 recovery effort, providing stability for Canadian businesses in this uncertain time.In the two years since CETA came into effect, twoway trade between Canada and the EU has increased by nearly 15%. Through CETA, Canada and the EU are working to ensure our trade relations are more inclusive by ensuring that everyone – including women and small business owners – can share in the benefits of trade.Minister Ng impressed the need for Canada and the EU to work together to ensure Canadian businesses and workers – specifically our farmers, producers, and manufacturers – benefit from the agreement. She underscored the importance of improving EU market access for Canadian agricultural products through the removal of technical barriers to trade. She also emphasized the need to accelerate the accreditation of Canadian conformity assessment bodies responsible for the certification of Canadian goods to EU requirements.The Minister and Commissioner discussed the need for strong international coordination through the G20 and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and highlighted their critical work in establishing the WTO MultiParty Interim Arrangement to underpin rulesbased trade throughout the pandemic and beyond.

We also reaffirmed our support for the central role of the WTO in international trade.“Businesses and workers depend on stability, predictability, and open global supply chains to do business around the world—and this also ensures that people get the essential goods and services they need when they need them.“Coordinating with our international partners is critical to ensuring that Canadian businesses, whether small or mediumsized, have the tools, resources, and relief they need during this unprecedented time.“We continue to take extraordinary measures to help small businesses overcome this crisis and build resilience for future challenges.”"

This includes enhancing transparency; improving air, land and marine connectivity; and strengthening international investment and the multilateral trading system.During the meeting, Minister Ng highlighted the importance of prioritizing tradesupport measures over export restrictions, as well as the critical role of multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) in ensuring the economic stability, security and prosperity of Canadians and people around the world.The ministers also discussed specific challenges faced by the most vulnerable people, including those in small businesses. Minister Ng raised the WTO statement on supporting small businesses, endorsed by 49 WTO members today, as bringing muchneeded attention to need to help them through this crisis.Minister Ng emphasized the need for countries to follow through on the collective actions in the G20 action plan without delay to benefit businesses, workers, and people."
278,Backgrounder – Canadian support for global vaccinations,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/05/backgrounder--canadian-support-for-global-vaccinations.html,5/12/20,2020, backgrounders,"Despite the positive impact of strong routine immunization programs, about 1.5 million children under the age of 5 die annually of vaccinepreventable diseases. An estimated 20 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines.A recent Johns Hopkins University study confirmed that immunization is one of the best buys in public health. The overall economic gain will exceed US$1.5 trillion between 2011 and 2020 across the 94 countries in the study.Infectious diseases affect women and girls disproportionately due to their role as the main caregivers for the sick, especially children.Outbreaks of diseases such as the Ebola virus, Zika virus and cholera can develop into unforeseen public health emergencies, where gender inequalities can increase women’s and girls’ exposure, reduce their access to health resources and skew monitoring and reporting of health risks and outcomes.Supporting Gavi is a high priority for Canada, given the organization’s strong track record for saving the lives of children and protecting people’s health by increasing the use of vaccines in vulnerable countries.Gavi supports vaccines that immunize children against pneumonia, diarrhea and meningitis, some of the world’s leading killers of children.A third replenishment conference for Gavi is scheduled for June 2020 in London, United Kingdom, to be hosted by Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. There, donors will make their pledges for the next strategic period from 2021 to 2025. The focus for this period is on addressing genderrelated barriers to immunization. The conference will be held virtually.Established in 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is a partnership between the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Canada has been a longstanding donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is aligned with Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy and intends to ensure equitable access to lifesaving vaccines and increase the representation of women as community social mobilizers and vaccinators."

Canada remains committed to ensuring access to essential vaccinations, leading efforts to advance gender equality and reducing the burden of infectious diseases.The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today announced new support to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s endgame strategy, toward ensuring regular routine immunizations for hundreds of million children around the world. The Minister made this announcement at the launch of the Group of Friends of Solidarity for Global Health Security virtual meeting, which she cohosted alongside her counterparts from Denmark, Qatar, the Republic of Korea and Sierra Leone.This replenishment funding ensures that Gavi is able to build on its incredible reach with vaccinations by identifying opportunities for advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights programming, in partnership with communities and local organizations. Predictable financing will allow Gavi to save between 7 million and 8 million lives.Gavi is currently helping lowincome countries respond to COVID19 outbreaks, including making additional funding available for strengthening health systems. When a COVID19 vaccine is developed, Gavi will be well positioned to ensure the scaleup of manufacturing, access and allocation, along with timely delivery, of new vaccines in vulnerable countries.At the same time, front line workers in many countries are using networks established by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to focus on case detection, tracing, testing and data management.Global efforts to eradicate polio have already prevented 18 million cases of paralysis, and the wild poliovirus has been eliminated from 99.9% of the world’s regions. This is one of the great global health success stories of the last 30 years, and Canada is proud to have been a partner every step of the way—especially now, with victory and eradication so close.Canada is pledging $600 million to the third replenishment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and committing $47.5 million annually over four years to support the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s endgame strategy.Today’s funding investments will help the World Health Organization, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Gavi and other partners support the most vulnerable countries by working to ensure that routine immunization continues, that we do not lose the gains we have made in global health and that we prevent a resurgence of polio and other communicable diseases for which we have vaccines."

Around the world, the pandemic is having a devastating impact on health systems, economies and the lives, livelihood and wellbeing of all, particularly older people. Responding effectively to this fastgrowing pandemic requires solidarity and cooperation among all governments, scientists, civil society actors and the private sector. COVID19 affects women and men differently. The pandemic makes existing inequalities for women and girls, as well as discrimination of other marginalized groups such as persons with disabilities and those in extreme poverty worse and risk impeding the realization of human rights for women and girls. Participation, protection and potential of all women and girls must be at the center of response efforts. These efforts must be genderresponsive and consider different impacts surrounding detection, diagnosis and access to treatment for all women and men.The restrictive measures designed to limit the spread of the virus around the world, increase the risk of domestic violence, including intimate partner violence. As health and social protection as well as legal systems that protect all women and girls under normal circumstances are weakened or under pressure by the COVID19, specific measures should be implemented to prevent violence against women and girls. The emergency responses should ensure that all women and girls who are refugees, migrants or internally displaced are protected. Sexual and reproductive health needs, including psychosocial support services, and protection from genderbased violence, must be prioritized to ensure continuity. We must also assume responsibility for social protection and ensure adolescent health, rights and wellbeing during schools closedown. Any restrictions to the enjoyment of human rights should be prescribed by law, and in accordance with international law and rigorously assessed.We support the active participation and leadership of women and girls at all levels of decisionmaking, including at community level, through their networks and organizations, to ensure efforts and response are genderresponsive and will not further discriminate and exclude those most at risk.It is crucial that leaders recognize the central role of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in health emergencies and the need for robust health systems to save lives. In this context, sexual health services are essential. We recommit to the immediate implementation of the UHC political declaration by all. Funding sexual and reproductive health and rights should remain a priority to avoid a rise in maternal and newborn mortality, increased unmet need for contraception, and an increased number of unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections.Around the world, midwives, nurses and community health workers are essential to contain COVID19 and they require personal protective equipment. Safe pregnancy and childbirth depend on all these health workers, adequate health facilities, and strict adherence to infection prevention. Respiratory illnesses in pregnant women, particularly COVID19 infections, must be priority due to increased risk of adverse outcomes. As our national and international supply chains are impacted by this pandemic, we recommit to providing all women and girls of reproductive age with reproductive health commodities. And we call on governments around the world to ensure full and unimpeded access to all sexual and reproductive health services for all women and girls.We welcome the multilateral efforts, including by the UN, including UNFPA and UN Women, WHO, the World Bank and IMF, and regional development banks, as well as the G7 and G20 declarations, towards a coherent and global response to COVID19. We encourage them all in their efforts with national governments and other partners to ensure an effective response and assurance of the continuation of essential health services and rights.We must coordinate our efforts in this global health crisis. We support the UN General Assembly resolution entitled Global Solidarity to fight COVID19. And we encourage all governments, the private sector, civil society, philanthropists and others to join us in supporting the emergency response, particularly in the most vulnerable countries, and to give full effect to the global commitment to universal access to health care."

We thank the more than 270 participants who attended.“We were seized by the real concerns that the current health crisis could trigger a food crisis in many regions of the world, especially in Africa and Small Islands Developing States, further imperiling the health and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people, in particular in fragile contexts. Such a crisis could lead to additional negative consequences to health. Signs of disruptions to food supply chains are already visible as countries move to enact measures to halt the pandemic.“We were reminded of how many countries rely heavily on regular imports of basic staples and food distribution channels. There are particular vulnerabilities in many developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America, including among Least Developed Countries, LandLocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States, where agriculture is the backbone of the economy and employment. Local, regional, and global food security will depend more than ever on strengthening the resilience of food systems to withstand multiple shocks, and also on helping smallholder farmers, fishers, pastoralists and food processors – many of whom are women – obtain inputs, plant and harvest their crops, and sell their products for a fair price in a safe environment.“We were struck by the urgent call for action, taking into account the upcoming planting and harvest seasons and the need to enhance the resilience of the food supply chain, recognizing the potential impact of major demand and supply shocks on agrifood producers, agricultural workers and the large number of women and men employed in related activities. We welcomed the active and close collaboration of the Romebased UN agencies (FAO, IFAD and WFP), at headquarters and in the field, leveraging their expertise on food security in support of countries’ actions to minimize unintended impacts of the COVID19 response on food supply, global trade and food security. This included collaboration with other partners such as WHO, WTO and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs). We call on the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) of the G20 to continue monitoring global food markets and policies and provide timely and reliable information, thus enhancing transparency and supporting timely and evidencebased decisionmaking.More than ever, we need to work together in a coordinated and integrated manner, in coherence with the three pillars of action of the UN system: peace and security, sustainable development and human rights. Strengthening the fundamental nexus between humanitarian assistance and sustainable development will also be crucial. We welcome new collaborative initiatives, and in this spirit, we look forward to further details regarding the Food Coalition proposed by Italy.“Today, Italy, as Chair of the Group of Friends of Food Security and Nutrition, Brazil, Canada and Egypt stand committed to supporting the UN system at the global, regional and country level, engaging the WTO, the IFIs and the G20 to ensure that trade measures do not restrict the flow of food and critical agricultural inputs across borders in the short and long term. Open, transparent, and predictable trade is critical to keep food supply chains going and prices stable during and after the COVID19 pandemic crisis. We look forward to the outcomes of the upcoming G20 Agriculture Ministers’ meeting.In these challenging times, we must ensure everyone, especially the most vulnerable, can have access to adequate, safe, affordable and nutritious food and that smallholder farmers and processors receive the inputs, agriculture technologies, scientific based information, liquidity, taking into account the need to address risks of debt vulnerabilities in developing countries due to the pandemic, and the access to markets they need to produce, store, and sell food, invest in women and ensure they have access to land, credit and digital information. The aftermath of the COVID19 crisis can be an opportunity to build back better and achieve global food security and decent livelihood for all.The path towards the 2021 Food Systems Summit also provides a timely opportunity for all food systems actors to strengthen the resilience and sustainability of our food systems to help galvanize the postemergency recovery through a set of initiatives focused on innovation, financing, technology, partnerships and new levels of regional and global collaboration and information sharing.”"

In particular, it may have devastating health outcomes for the world’s most marginalized populations. They stressed the importance of working with developingcountry partners to strengthen health systems to enhance resilience going forward. In particular, they agreed on the importance of focusing on primary healthcare systems as communities recover after the pandemic.Minister Gould and Dr. Tedros also discussed the critical need for a postcrisis afteraction review that will be important to provide insights and learning to both member states and the WHO and support improvements to response and preparedness efforts in the future. Dr. Tedros affirmed the WHO’s commitment to full transparency and accountability.In conclusion, Minister Gould reiterated Canada’s unwavering commitment to combat the pandemic, which includes supporting the WHO’s critical role in maintaining supply chains of essential goods, notably medical supplies. Canada is particularly concerned about the challenges faced by smallisland developing states and subSaharan Africa. Minister Gould and Dr. Tedros agreed to remain in close contact with one another as the global pandemic continues to evolve."

298,Joint statement of the Alliance for multilateralism,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/04/joint-statement-of-the-alliance-for-multilateralism.html,4/16/20,2020, statements,"We need strong global cooperation and solidarity to fight COVID19The COVID19 pandemic is a wakeup call for multilateralism. Trying to cope with the immediate devastating effects of the virus, nations have turned toward imposing unprecedented executive measures, including closing borders. However, a virus knows no borders. All countries are affected. We must remain united in our shared humanity. The fight against this global pandemic, which is taking so many lives and challenging our societies, requires more and enhanced international cooperation and worldwide solidarity.Containing and countering this pandemic calls for a cooperative, transparent, sciencebased and coordinated global response. We are concerned by the serious threat to all countries, particularly developing and least developed countries, countries in situations of conflict and postconflict countries, where health systems are less prepared, as well as the particular risk faced by refugees and displaced persons.We realise that the pandemic poses a serious threat to the essential right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. At the same time, in a situation of emergency, it is of utmost importance to maintain principles of democracy and the rule of law. We call on all governments to strictly ensure that any measures taken to counter the pandemic must be necessary and proportionate, pursue legitimate purposes, be limited in time, nondiscriminatory and respectful of international law, including human rights law. Adopting a genderresponsive approach will be essential. With respect to nondiscriminatory policies, we support the statement of the High Commissioner for Human rights, issued on March 6, recalling that human dignity and rights should remain at the core of the response to the crisis, and that responses should be holistic and peoplecentric.The COVID19 crisis has demonstrated just how crucial multilateral institutions are to our collective health, prosperity, and security. We fully support the World Health Organization in leading the global public health response, as well as the efforts of the wider United Nations, the World Bank Group, and other international and regional organizations as they come together in a coordinated, coherent whole to respond to the wider socioeconomic impacts of the crisis.We strongly support the appeal by United Nations SecretaryGeneral António Guterres for an immediate global ceasefire. It is time to stop armed conflict and immediately halt fighting and devote all our energy and resources to fighting the world’s common challenge – the coronavirus. We express our gratitude to health and humanitarian workers for their indispensable role in saving lives and commit to preserve, and advocate for, the space they need to deliver on their lifesaving mandate. We thank civil society leaders for their determination to protect the most vulnerable.  We support efforts to urgently address the humanitarian dimension of the COVID19 outbreak. We are ready to play our part in responding to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID19 by the United Nations. We commend the UN Secretary General for launching a COVID19 response and recovery fund for low and middleincome countries to tackle the health emergency, address social and economic consequences of the crisis and assist in the recovery and support efforts to strengthen coordination and collaboration across response efforts.The health challenge: The focus must now be on the most immediate medical, political and economic challenges raised by the pandemic. We support the United Nations’ call for shared responsibility and global solidarity in response to the impacts of COVID19, and especially the role of WHO in the coordination of the health response to the epidemic. We seek to ensure sufficient financing to address the pandemic, including strengthening of health systems globally. We support working towards a response that delivers universal access to treatment and vaccines, when they are ready.  Fair and just distribution will be key. We propose to focus on the universal provision of an eventual treatment and a vaccine and recognize immunization against COVID19 as a global public good.The financial challenge: We will seek to ensure adequate financing to contain the pandemic and protect people, with particular attention to the most vulnerable. We commit, on a voluntary basis, to provide resources in support of the WHO’s COVID19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan , as well as the health organizations involved in identifying and scaling up the tools needed to fight the pandemic: the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance UNITAID and the Global Fund, and call upon all countries, international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, and individuals to contribute to these efforts. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to assist those countries whose economies are most at risk due to the pandemic and to improve resilience.The information challenge: Disinformation puts peoples’ lives at risk and is an obstacle to effective public health responses. We call on all states to provide and promote accessible, timely and factual information, to continue to protect and promote access to free and independent media and to support the free exchange of reliable and accurate information. We support the efforts of the WHO and internet intermediaries to step up efforts in detecting and addressing misinformation and prioritizing trustworthy information on their platforms. We commend journalists and other media workers on their work that serves to keep societies informed credibly, to protect the health of communities and to prevent false or misleading information. We express concern at the damage which can and has been done by the spreading of false or manipulated information intended to deliberately deceive, including disinformation about the virus outbreak and response. We need to push back disinformation and propaganda.  Access to reliable information and to free and independent media is crucial to foster transparency and accountability, combat misinformation and contribute to public confidence and support for government efforts to combat the pandemic. We will work with public health authorities to ensure access to timely and accurate information. We are concerned by attempts to use this crisis to put in place undue restrictions or to deny societies critical information on the spread of the disease. We must work together to amplify evidencebased messaging.The prevention challenge: We must also address the longterm consequences of this crisis. The world must prepare better for the next pandemic. We will lend our support to strengthening health systems globally, including through supporting the WHO, other UN agencies as well as other international health organizations. The COVID pandemic should be an opportunity to strengthen the global health security system. In order to reduce the risk of future pandemics we should promote the ""One Health"" approach as outlined by the WHO. We support efforts by the WHO to assess gaps with a view to enhancing pandemic preparedness and response, and further stress the urgency of ensuring a healthy environment, achieving universal health coverage, and promoting effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The multilateral system needs to adapt and reform to ‘recover better’. We call upon the WHO, IMF, WBG and all relevant UN agencies and international health organizations to further step up coordination of their actions, including with the private sector, to support emerging and developing countries in facing the health, economic, and social shocks following the COVID19 outbreak. We support the efforts of the WHO to assess gaps in pandemic preparedness with a view to establish a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response.The economic challenge: The continued efficient flow of medical supplies, agricultural products, and other goods and services across borders will be critical for effective crisis response, to help minimize global supply and demand shocks, and to enable timely economic recovery. We will therefore work to minimize disruptions to cross border trade and global supply chains, and taking only targeted, proportionate, transparent, and temporary emergency measures and only those consistent with our WTO obligations.As we strive to ‘recover better’ our common roadmap remains the 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. We welcome the unanimous adoption of UNGA resolution 74/270 on Global solidarity to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) at the initiative of Ghana, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland.Faced with the unprecedented challenge posed by the COVID19 pandemic, we must all join forces to contain, counter and prevent its spread. The Alliance for Multilateralism is committed to support the UN, WHO, and other international organizations in their efforts toward this end. We are only as strong as the weakest link in the global health system. Only by building a more sustainable and resilient world through enhanced international cooperation can we overcome this threat to humanity.H.E. FM of the Argentine Republic, Mr. Felipe SoláH.E.

Our peopletopeople links are the foundation of our relationship. Canada, the EU and EU member states have assisted each other’s stranded nationals to return home from our respective territories and from around the world. We are facilitating transit through Canadian and EU airports, providing access to spare capacity on our respective repatriation flights and advocating for the maintenance of commercial air links between Europe and North America.Developing effective vaccines, therapies and diagnostics. Collaboration in international research and innovation is essential in the global fight against the COVID19 pandemic. The EU and Canada are committed to increasing research and innovation funding for vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to leverage digital technologies, and to strengthen scientific international cooperation. We support the leadership of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness network and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in international efforts to develop vaccines. We also support initiatives on data sharing for all COVID19related funded research at the global level, such as the UNESCO plea on data sharing and open science, as well as the open letter to publishers on open access to COVID19 research, signed in March by the European Commission and Canada and 14 other countries.On direct funding, Canada recently announced a further contribution to CEPI of Can$40 million, while the EU has undertaken several emergency initiatives, including two emergency calls for research and innovation projects: €48 million in funding for the launch of 18 new Horizon 2020 research and innovation projects, and a €45million call of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI).Protecting the flow of vital supplies across borders. The Canadian and EU economies are highly intertwined. We are working together to make sure that critical materials aimed at protecting our health workers and citizens can continue to cross borders. We are reviewing our own emergency measures and are pressing the international community to maintain open and connected supply chains to facilitate the flow of essential goods, especially medical equipment to combat the pandemic. We remain committed to a transparent, rulesbased trading system more generally, as a means to support the resilience of supply chains to continue to function in this crisis and to expedite the economic recovery that will follow.Strengthening the global response. The EU and Canada are reinforcing relevant international organizations, with the World Health Organization leading the global response, and are assisting developing countries and nongovernmental organizations in the fight against COVID19. To date, Canada has announced over Can$160 million in direct support of global efforts to address the COVID19 outbreak, while the EU will secure €15.6 billion to help partner countries to face COVID impacts. In order to step up global efforts to address the COVID19 outbreak, we are engaged in actively supporting an international pledging conference in cooperation with WHO and its Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, and in assisting developing countries and nongovernmental organizations in the fight against COVID19. The EU and Canada recall that both the UN and our own autonomous sanctions regimes provide for humanitarian exceptions; the application of these exceptions should enable humanitarian assistance to reach the most vulnerable populations.Countering disinformation. Canada and the EU are longstanding partners in promoting security and prosperity around the world. Together, we are working through the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, which is linked to the EU’s Rapid Alert System, to identify and respond to foreign threats to our democracies, including the spread of disinformation and myths about the virus and efforts to undermine our unity. We underline the need to defend media freedom and the free exchange of information more than ever during such times of crisis.Canada and the EU underline the value in bilateral and multilateral cooperation as our citizens, and the global community, face unprecedented challenges to public health and economic stability. We will continue to act, in mutually supportive ways, to address the crisis and then to move beyond it."

We thank the more than 300 participants who attended.“We were struck by the unity and common purpose of all to overcome the unprecedented challenge before us and the resolve to take the necessary actions required to help contain the COVID19 pandemic, conscious that the depth of the economic contraction and the speed of recovery are not yet known.“We welcomed the commitment by the UN, G20, IMF, World Bank Group, OECD and individual countries to coordinate their actions to ensure an effective response, with all participants recognizing that no one country or organization can tackle the challenge of COVID19 on their own.“We were also reminded of the particular vulnerabilities many countries suffer. Small island developing states and many other developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean are confronted with a multipronged challenge, including a reliance on imported food; logistics and transportation hubs whose operations have been curtailed; preexisting high levels of indebtedness; a loss of primary revenue sources; and the need to use scarce foreign currency reserves to procure essential medical supplies.“We discussed the need to take urgent action to ensure that global supply chains remain open, and that the flows of remittances are able to continue with minimal disruption and at reduced costs. We also stressed the crucial importance of supporting our private sectors through these difficult times as they are the primary source of jobs and livelihoods. No economic recovery will be possible without it.“Canada and Jamaica stand more committed than ever to ensure that countries are provided the support they need to overcome these complex challenges and will use every avenue available to us to advance this cause. Today’s meeting represents an important step toward this shared objective.“As this pandemic affects everyone, everywhere, the world needs to come together to address and mitigate the human, social, and economic challenges posed by COVID19.”Related linksMinister Champagne to copreside meeting with UN member states on COVID19"

Now is the time to put armed conflict on lockdown, to protect the most vulnerable and to focus our efforts together in the fight against this virus. We are proud to have led 58 countries in supporting the SecretaryGeneral’s appeal, and we encourage all countries to do the same.“As COVID19 continues to spread, Canada is particularly concerned about the plight of women, children and vulnerable civilians caught in armed conflict and humanitarian crises. We know that these populations are already disproportionately affected by armed conflict, that they are more vulnerable to economic and food insecurity and that they are at even greater risk now because of this pandemic. This is why a global ceasefire is so important.“Canada is working hard to prioritize the protection of the most vulnerable in the response to the pandemic, including through our most recent funding of the UN system and international partners. We offer Canada’s full support to, and stand in solidarity with, those on the front lines of the response and the civilians and vulnerable populations in conflict, who require protection now more than ever. During this unprecedented global crisis, we also wish to reiterate Canada’s full commitment to multilateralism and the rulesbased international order.”"

303,Statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs on release of report by Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on chemical attacks in Syria,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/04/statement-by-minister-of-foreign-affairs-on-release-of-report-by-organisation-for-the-prohibition-of-chemical-weapons-on-chemical-attacks-in-syria.html,4/10/20,2020, statements," The Honourable FrançoisPhilippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement:“On April 8, the Investigation and Identification Team of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] released its first report. In the report, the team identifies the Syrian Arab Air Force as the perpetrator of several chemical weapon attacks carried out in Syria in March 2017. The overwhelming majority of victims of these attacks were civilians.“We condemn the Assad regime’s repeated and morally reprehensible attacks on the people of Syria, in particular, its use of chemical weapons. Any use of chemical weapons is an abhorrent breach of international law. Canada wholly supports efforts to ensure that perpetrators of such crimes are held to account.“As a state party to the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC], Syria has an obligation to fully eliminate its chemical weapons program. It has repeatedly failed to do so. We demand that the Assad regime declare its entire chemical weapons stockpile without delay so that it may be verifiably destroyed, as required under the CWC.“Canada is committed to upholding the international rulesbased order, including the prohibition on chemical weapons, and stands firmly against those who seek to undermine that order. The use of chemical weapons is unequivocally a war crime, and those who commit such crimes must be brought to justice without delay.“Canada fully supports the Investigation and Identification Team and stands by the legitimacy and credibility of its work. This report alone cannot possibly provide adequate closure to the victims of these abhorrent crimes. However, it is our hope that through continued support of the work of the OPCW and other such accountability efforts, Canada and its partners in the international community can work toward the realization of a world free of chemical weapons.”Quick factsThe OPCW is an independent, treatybased body established in 1997 to implement the CWC. With over 190 states parties, the CWC is one of the world’s most widely subscribed treaties. It bans all chemical weapons and oversees their destruction in a verifiable manner.The OPCW is the only multilateral institution charged with eradicating an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. To date, it has verified the elimination of 97% of the world’s declared chemical weapons.The Joint Investigative Mechanism, created by the United Nations and the OPCW, had previously concluded that the Government of Syria used chemical weapons against its own people. The mechanism was dissolved when Russia used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to block its renewal.On June 27, 2018, the Fourth Special Session of the Conference of the States Parties (to the CWC) decided to establish the Investigation and Identification Team to identify those responsible for chemical weapons use in Syria.Associated linksSyria and the OPCWOPCW releases first report by Investigation and Identification TeamCanada condemns alleged chemical weapons attack in SyriaCanada welcomes OPCW actions to counter impunity for use of chemical weaponsCanada calls for Syria to be held accountable for its use of chemical weaponsCanadian sanctions related to Syria"

This contract is governed exclusively by Saudi law and subject to the Saudi judicial system.“Under the agreement signed in 2014, the terms of the contract were strictly confidential, preventing the government from discussing the contents with Canadians.“The government undertook negotiations to improve the terms of the contract. Today, we are announcing that, as a result of these negotiations, we have been able to secure significant improvements to the contract.“This includes now being able to communicate more transparently with Canadians about certain terms of the contract.“We can confirm that the cancellation of this $14billion contract—or even the mere disclosure of any of its terms—could have resulted in billions of dollars in damages to the Government of Canada, with potential damages amounting to the full value of the contract. This would have put the jobs of thousands of Canadians at risk, not only in Southwestern Ontario but also across the entire defence industry supply chain, which includes hundreds of small and medium enterprises.“Additionally, under the improved agreement, we have ensured that Canadians’ exposure to financial risk will be eliminated where future export permits are delayed or denied if there is an infringement of the permit’s end use assurances—which ensure that the vehicles are used only for the stated purpose.“In addition, in order to ensure that the government always upholds the highest standards with respect to human rights, we are announcing the creation of an armslength advisory panel of experts who will review best practices regarding arms exports by state parties to the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty [ATT] to ensure that our system is as robust as possible.“Canada officially joined the ATT on September 17, 2019. With the passage of Bill C47, the implementing legislation, Canada now has one of the most robust legal applications of this UN treaty in the world.“Under our law, Canadian goods cannot be exported where there is a substantial risk that they would be used to commit or to facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law, international human rights law or serious acts of genderbased violence.“We need to ensure that we are always ready to strengthen available tools to conduct proper due diligence on all exports, as Canadians expect.“To that end, we are also announcing that we will spearhead multilateral discussions on means to strengthen international compliance with the ATT, toward the establishment of an international inspection regime.“Following the conclusion of the review of export permits to Saudi Arabia conducted by officials from Global Affairs Canada—including those related to this contract—we have now begun reviewing permit applications on a casebycase basis. As always, we will ensure that they comply with the aforementioned legal requirements under Canadian law and the ATT.”"

In more than 90 countries, including Canada, this has meant restricting personal movement in an effort to limit the transmission of the disease.“We are concerned about the risk of discrimination, excessive use of force and violations of fundamental rights and freedoms that have already occurred in some countries during the implementation of lockdowns and mandatory isolation. While the need to protect public health is vital, it is imperative to ensure that these measures are not used to undermine the fundamental civil liberties and human rights of all people.“Promoting and protecting these essential liberties and rights is, and will remain, a priority for the Government of Canada.“To that end, we urge all states to ensure that restrictions on movement and peaceful assembly are grounded in legitimate public health concerns and are not used to infringe on the people’s essential freedoms. While we are all called upon to sacrifice some parts of our normal lives, we must remain vigilant that this requirement is not abused or taken advantage of.“We must all do what we can to prevent the tragedy of this pandemic from being compounded by allowing it to be exploited to persecute vulnerable communities. Over the course of this crisis, the Government of Canada will work to ensure that vulnerable and marginalized communities, including refugees, internally displaced people and migrants, indigenous, LGBTQ2I+, and religious and ethnic minority communities, are not victimized under the cover of public health.“Furthermore, we recognize that isolating at home can be very difficult for many families. For people facing domestic and sexual and genderbased violence, COVID19 has created a perfect storm of isolation, stress and fear. Genderbased and childprotection services are essential and lifesaving, and we urge governments around the world to prioritize and integrate these critical services in all responses related to COVID19.“Canada has taken a gender based approach to its response both domestically and internationally. Canada also took concrete steps to address domestic violence and is joining the United Nation SecretaryGeneral’s call on domestic violence.“Protecting public health and respecting human rights are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they cannot be separated as they go hand in hand toward ensuring the health, safety and security of our communities and our countries. Together, we can respond to the COVID19 pandemic swiftly and decisively, but also with compassion, inclusivity and respect for the fundamental rights of everyone.”"

Amref Canada, for example, focuses on reaching vulnerable populations to increase the awareness of and access to quality maternal and reproductive health services.“On this World NGO Day, we celebrate these organizations that stand up in the most challenging situations to end poverty and hunger, to achieve gender equality, to foster peace, to build real partnerships and to protect the planet for future generations.”"

We had also just signed the TransPacific Partnership Agreement. And today, as you know, we are finalizing the ratification of the new NAFTA.This means that today, Canada has privileged access to nearly 1.2 billion consumers thanks to modern and progressive trade agreements, making Canada the only G7 country to have a free trade agreement with all other G7 members. It is a fact that I take pride in repeating in all the forums around the world.This is great news for our economy and for our businesses. For our artists, for the environment, for youth.I’ve repeatedly said it, over the past 35 years: CORIM has carved out a place for itself as the ultimate Montréal, Quebec and Canadian platform to offer those who share an interest in world affairs an exceptional forum for discussion.Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you about the mandate given to me by Prime Minister Trudeau, for Canadian foreign policy, as we enter this third decade of the 21st century.Canada’s interests, values ​​and principles are at the heart of everything we do on the international stage.From our commitment within multilateral institutions, to our trade agreements, through our defence and promotion of human rights.This approach is more relevant and more important than ever in an increasingly unpredictable world.A world in which the international system, as we know it, is under severe strain.Ladies and gentlemen,As you know, our world is going through a period of deep transformations and uncertainties.We see this with, among other things, a rise in populism, a rise in protectionism and a growth in economic and technological inequalities.We also see it with a rise in economic, political and diplomatic power from the West to Asia.We see this with a decline in human rights and an upsurge in the selective application of international law.Finally, we see this with a profound questioning of multilateral institutions and of the rulebased international order.Indeed, we are seeing the emergence of a multipolar world with new epicentres of influence and competition over ideas and models of governance.Around the world, human rights are increasingly under threat.From the devastating plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar, to a rise of antisemitic and Islamophobic rhetoric and behaviour, to attacks on front line human rights defenders. From impunity for those who abuse their power, to the flouting of international law.Add to this portrait the immense demographic transformation taking place in the world. By 2050, the world’s population could increase by 2.2 billion, almost half of which in Africa alone.The 10 countries with the youngest populations in the world are all in Africa with a median age of around 16 years. This continent will offer immense possibilities but will also have its share of difficulties to overcome if the international community does not maintain the necessary support for stability, economic security or education. It is with this in mind that I went to Africa three times in three months to listen, exchange and help.All this, without mentioning the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis, as the recent fires in Australia remind us so well.And to those who still doubt the urgency of this crisis, our message is clear on all the stands: Yes, the climate crisis is very real! And yes, we must take immediate urgent action to deal with it individually and collectively.And this climate crisis cannot and must not be used as a political or partisan issue.The climate crisis is the moral challenge of our time, and Canada will continue to play a leading role in the fight against climate change.When it comes to the climate crisis, the cost of inaction and failure far, far exceeds the price of action.Ladies and gentlemen,We live in a complex world.A complex and increasingly unpredictable world, as evidenced by the coronavirus epidemic or the situation we are currently facing with Iran.But in this complex and fraught world, there are also hopeful signs.Inspirational people around the world are advancing our societies and improving the lives of marginalized people.There is a growing consensus that there is an urgent need to act on the climate crisis, largely among young people who are bravely sounding the alarm. The young Canadian Autumn Peltier, the water rights warrior, is a prime example.There is also a growing consensus on human rights, including women’s rights, the rights of LGBTQ2 people and democratic rights.From Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, people stand up and demand that their government respect these rights. Canada is proud to stand by their side.Increasingly, women are taking their place at the negotiating table, whether to resolve conflicts, conclude trade agreements or rule cities and countries.Canada is proud to have a feminist foreign policy, not because it looks good, but because it produces tangible and measurable results. I witnessed it first hand during my recent visit to Mali and across Africa. It is not a question of strengthening the power of women, they are already strong; it is a question of removing the obstacles to their full emancipation, to their leadership.Our agenda on women, peace and security is a central element of our policy.In fact, during this mandate, I will strengthen the foundations of this policy by working with civil society to launch a white paper on Canada’s feminist foreign policy.In short, we live in a world where the possibilities for international collaboration and cooperation are limitless, largely thanks to the standards and multilateral institutions established over the past 75 years.Since the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed one of the longest periods of peace between great powers in history and the unprecedented creation of wealth, even if it is true they are not distributed fairly.This remarkable feat is based on the principle that major international challenges require global solutions. The idea that the challenges facing humanity cannot be solved within the confines of states alone.Hence the existence of a framework of institutions and standards commonly known as the rulesbased international order.A framework that all countries, no matter how small, can count on to defend their interests while ensuring the collective interests of the entire international community.It is a framework through which we have been able to advance Canada’s foreign policy priorities for decades. As Henri Lacordaire said, “Between the weak and the strong, it is the law that liberates.”But rulesbased international order is under threat today.This is why it is necessary to support and modernize the multilateral system in order to ensure its sustainability while adapting it to the new realities of today.And this is where Canada can and must play a leading role on the international stage.It’s not only in our national interest, it’s also what the international community expects from Canada.Why?Because Canada has not only always been a champion and defender of multilateralism, but Canada has also been at the root of the institutions, principles and values ​​that drive multilateralism.In the earliest days after World War II, for example, Canada was there, helping to create the Bretton Woods institutions.In 1947, Canada was among the 23 nations that signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would later become the World Trade Organization.Canada is a founding member of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO].A Canadian, John Humphrey, was actively engaged in shaping the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which still today serves as the foundation to protect the dignity of all people.Another Canadian, Lester B. Pearson, earned the Nobel Peace Prize for devising the form of military intervention that has come to be known as peacekeeping.And that’s not all.Let us remember Lloyd Axworthy, who was the architect of the Ottawa Treaty banning antipersonnel mines.It was also Canada, when we sat on the UN Security Council, that pioneered the concept of the “responsibility to protect,” a mechanism to protect victims of genocide. Like the women’s peace and security agenda, a very Canadian initiative.Ladies and gentlemen,As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to assert and exercise our leadership internationally.And the good news is that we have everything to succeed and assume this leadership.Canada has a voice at almost every table: the G7, the G20, La Francophonie, the Commonwealth, NATO, the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] and so on.The very principles on which our country’s confederation is founded—peace, order and good government—resonate in many corners of the planet.But let’s be clear: our reputation and credibility rest on our ability to demonstrate to our partners and allies how—in concrete terms—our principles and values ​​guide our diplomacy.Let me now present to you the priorities that will guide my mandate as minister of foreign affairs; priorities to advance Canada’s interests through multilateralism, trade and human rights.IranFirst, Iran and the tragedy of Flight PS752, a tragedy that illustrates once again the importance of diplomacy and multilateralism and the need to adapt quickly to circumstances.We chose dialogue while remaining firm so that justice could be done for the families of the victims.Canada has shown leadership with the creation of the International Coordination and Response Group for Victims of Flight PS752, which ensures that the international community speaks with one voice visàvis Iran.And despite the pitfalls, despite the lack of diplomatic relations with the Iranian regime, we were able to quickly dispatch investigators to the field and repatriate the bodies of the victims, according to the wishes expressed by the families.That being said, much work remains to be done in order for Iran to fully assume responsibility for this tragic event, including a full and transparent investigation, the need for Iran to get the black boxes downloaded and analyzed without delay and a swift compensation settlement for the families of the victims based on international standards.We owe it to the families to get all the answers to the questions surrounding this terrible tragedy.We will continue to hold the Iranian regime accountable.We will judge Iran not by its words but by its actions. The world is watching.Regarding the black boxes, I repeat here the call of Canada and the international community to Iran: the black boxes must be transferred to France to be analyzed without delay, in accordance with Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation.ChinaNow let me talk about China.First, on the coronavirus epidemic and the global effort to contain it.As with the Zika virus epidemic in 2016, the Ebola virus in 2014, the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 or even SARS in 2003, it has always been vital that countries work together to prevent diseases from spreading.Renowned Canadian epidemiologist Dr. Bruce Aylward leads a team of WHO [World Health Organization] experts from around the world to China to study the coronavirus.Throughout this crisis, we have been in constant contact with international partners to work together as efficiently as necessary.And thanks to the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, we were able to repatriate nearly 550 of our citizens to the country.However, it should not be inferred that Canada’s relationship with China has returned to normal.As you know, our relationship with China is complex and multidimensional.The year 2020 marks 50 years of diplomatic relations between our two countries, and we are currently going through a turbulent period in our common diplomatic history.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been arbitrarily detained for over a year.Our top priority remains to secure their release.We are also working to obtain clemency for Robert Schellenberg, sentenced to death by China.Here again, faced with a difficult and complex situation, Canada is not going it alone.A multitude of international partners share our opinion: the actions of a state within the framework of an international treaty must not generate reprisals against its citizens abroad.That said, however difficult and complex it may be, Canadians know that our relationship with China remains important in many ways.Finding the right balance is a delicate operation. There will always be issues on which we will have differences and issues on which we will have overlapping positions. You have to learn to live with this complexity.I believe in dialogue even if it means having difficult conversations. That’s the nature of diplomacy.And, yes, it’s possible to work with China on the reform of the WTO [World Trade Organization], while at the same time not be aligned with China on human rights.Will we continue to emphasize the importance of global rules, principles and protections endorsed by the global community, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the Vienna Convention?Always.Our relations with China will always be guided by the interests of Canadians, as well as by our commitment to the rules and principles enshrined in international law.Another priority is our campaign for a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council.Let me first put this approach and the importance it has for Canada into context.As the Prime Minister once said, obtaining a seat on the Security Council is not an end in itself.A seat on the Security Council is above all a vehicle for promoting the principles and values ​​that shape our vision of international relations. A vision based on strong and effective multilateralism, and on an international rulebased order.We are witnessing a major questioning of the capacity of international institutions to respond to the crises of our time, particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America.As the model of liberal democracies is put to the test, there is an urgent need to develop new tools and new ways of doing things and to create a new consensus to better face these challenges.Our campaign for a seat on the Security Council is therefore an opportunity for our government to demonstrate our leadership in the face of the great challenges and crises of our time.The campaign is an opportunity to assert Canada’s interests, principles and values ​​to give credibility to multilateralism, strengthen it and better adapt it to the realities of today.From our chairing of the UN Peacebuilding Commission to the Alliance for Multilateralism and the Lima Group to restore democracy in Venezuela.From the Ottawa Group to the WTO, to the Vancouver Principles for the protection of children in armed conflict.From La Francophonie (which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year), including APEC [AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation] and the Commonwealth.From the Ocean Plastics Charter to the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, through to our copresidency of the next Global Conference for Media Freedom in Quebec on September 17 and 18, 2020—Canada is showing leadership on many international initiatives.Some will say that the fight for a Security Council seat is not worth it, or that it’s too late.My answer to that is, it’s never too late to fight for women’s rights, human rights, the environment and democracy.As for those who criticize the Security Council as outdated and ineffective, we agree that reform is needed. But allow me to paraphrase Winston Churchill, by saying, “It may not be perfect, but it’s the best thing we’ve got!”Indeed, the UN Security Council is still among the most important tables in the world where major decisions and discussions on peace and security are held.And it’s a place where Canada can have both relevance and influence.My speech would not be complete without, of course, talking about our bilateral relationship with the United States.We are allies, partners and friends, inseparable from our geography, our personal ties and our economic ties.The new NAFTA opens a new chapter in our relationship. A new chapter that will provide more prosperity, more opportunity and more stability.As evidenced by the sometimes difficult negotiations of the past two years, our government will always look after the interests of Canadians without compromise.I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister and my predecessor, Chrystia Freeland, for their tireless work, which allows us today to see the future in a much more positive light.In conclusion, the aims of our foreign policy and my priorities as minister are certainly ambitious.They have to be because Canada is an ambitious country.In a polarized world, the international community is asking that voices, like that of Canada, be raised to support and renew multilateralism, contribute to stability and prosperity, and defend the principles of law attached to it.Many will say that in a context of minority government, we will have to act quickly to achieve our objectives.But as the African proverb says so well: “If you want to go fast, walk alone. But if you want to go far, let’s walk together.”And that is what I intend to do during my mandate. Go far for Canada and with Canadians.Hence the importance of an inclusive approach, where the provinces, the business community, businesses, artists and civil society, in collaboration with our international partners, are all shoulder to shoulder, with us, for a greener, safer, more inclusive and more prosperous world.Thank you."

According to our assessment, these actions were carried out by the Sandworm Team, who are sponsored by the cyberunits of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU.“Canada strongly condemns these malicious activities. These actions are aimed at sowing discord in Georgia ahead of their parliamentary elections later this year and show blatant disregard for international law, norms and agreements.“They represent 1 case in an ongoing series of malicious activities by Russia, including the use of the NotPetya malware, which caused significant disruption in Ukraine in 2017; and the hacking of international sport and antidoping organizations in 2018, including the Canadabased World AntiDoping Agency and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport.“Canada remains steadfast in its solidarity with allies and partners in calling out malicious statesponsored cyberactivity.

Venezuela has been led down a path of economic collapse, human rights abuses, increased criminality and environmental destruction. The human suffering has reached an intolerable level. This only adds to the urgency for a peaceful and democratic way out of this rapidly deteriorating crisis.Venezuelans must be the ones to lead any return to democracy in Venezuela.  To this end, the Venezuelan people must have a voice in deciding their future.  While the Venezuelan Constitution calls for parliamentary elections in 2020, democracy will be fully restored in Venezuela only through free, fair and credible presidential elections. This process must include an independent National Electoral Council, an unbiased Supreme Court, international support and observation, full press freedom and political participation of all Venezuelans.While it is for Venezuelans to determine, the international community has a crucial role to play.  Today the Lima Group issues an appeal to the international community to join us in supporting a democratic future for Venezuela.  The world needs to come together to stop the human tragedy in Venezuela.In the coming days and weeks, representatives of the Lima Group will engage in an intensive period of outreach and consultation with all countries that have an interest in the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.  We believe it is time to send a clear and unequivocal message to Venezuelans that the time is now to end this crisis and that the international community stands ready to support this process."

This speech has been translated in accordance with the Government of Canada’s official languages policy and edited for posting and distribution in accordance with its communications policy.I would like to acknowledge the land on which we gather is the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin nation.Thank you to the Canadian Partnership for Women and Children's Health, and the Canadian Council for International CoOperation, for organizing this event to celebrate International Development Week 2020.Nearly 30 years ago, the Government of Canada dedicated the first week of February to highlighting the actions of Canadian international assistance workers striving to improve peoples’ lives and our planet’s wellbeing.Since then, we take this opportunity to celebrate the vision Canadians have for a better world, and to celebrate the people, like many of you in this room, who are committed to working every day to help improve the lives of the most vulnerable people around the world. The whole international assistance landscape has transformed over the last 30 years. We have made important strides in effectiveness, coordination, advancing gender equality, and innovation. We are seeing real advances in health outcomes, access to education, and food security, among others.But we have also seen new threats from climate change, the rise of populism and isolationism, massive displacements and greater humanitarian needs.The challenges the world faces are global in nature. As Canadians we need to, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to International Development.Because a more stable, secure and prosperous world matters for the stability, security and prosperity of Canadians.The drive to help the poorest and most vulnerable is fundamental to the Canadian identity. This was true 30 years ago, and remains true today. It is what guides us in our commitment to implement Agenda 2030.This is about supporting the empowerment of Indigenous women in Guyana to make their own flour and stake out financial independence.It’s about using innovative technology and existing cellphone networks to make getting a birth certificate in Tanzania possible.It’s about supporting young women in Bangladesh to study postnatal care and help mums and babies succeed.And it’s about projects like Sama Sama in Ghana or the hard work from the Canadian Foodgrains Bank that we just heard about.Allow me to extend and add my congratulations to both iDE and Jim Cornelius for the inaugural impact and innovation awards.Canada’s international assistance and the important work of Canadian development organizations like all of you has made a difference. There is no doubt of that.As we enter the UN decade of delivery, Canada’s commitment to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals agenda is more important than ever.That is why this year’s IDW theme is “Go for the Goals”, to highlight the urgency that exists, push for greater awareness, and build momentum for the decade of action that remains. Canadians are engaged and they are passionate about our role in the world. There are 2.5 million Canadians who will participate in IDW activities this year. That is awesome. But what about the Canadians who aren’t following our activities. Are we doing a good enough job of telling them our story? Of sharing why the work we do matters to them?Last month, I had the privilege of travelling to the Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.While in the DRC, I visited an IDP camp. I had the privilege of speaking with the people living there, seeking refuge from violence, living in the most challenging conditions. 45% of the households in this camp of 3,000 were led by women. One young mother who had just arrived, told me she walked for one week with her two children and her mother to reach the safety the camp afforded. They arrived wearing only the clothing on their backs. They had barely eaten throughout their journey.She undertook the trek so her two boys could find safety. So she could begin to build a life where they had a chance.Her story is all too familiar. There are 40 million people around the world who are internally displaced. One is in ten of them are in the DRC. Canadian support is reaching our world’s most vulnerable populations. Meeting this young woman, who courageously led her family to safety, reaffirmed for me the vital work that Canada does, and that you and your organizations, do around the world.It reaffirmed to me why providing support to this woman and her family matter for Canada. Inequality and instability in the world does not serve the interests of Canadians, be it at home or abroad, does not serve the interests of Canadians.A poorer world reduces our own opportunities, and a more unstable world is a threat to our own security.You have stories too. Stories of how Canadians and Canadian organizations are making an impact. Contributing to better maternal, newborn and child health. Improving access to SRHR. Immunizing millions of children against polio.It strikes me that what we should also be doing during International Development Week, is to retell the role Canadian civil society has played and continues to play in shaping the development agenda of the Government of Canada.Polio is a prime example of where Canadian civil society has been – and continues to be – a key driver of Canada’s commitment to eradicating polio globally. And I want to acknowledge the important role of Rotary International in being an early and committed champion.More recently, the role you played in the development of Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy cannot go without comment. I was incredibly fortunate to attend many of the consultations that your organizations participated in and I am so delighted to be able to deliver on our policy that is truly a reflection of your input.I would also like to highlight your vision and leadership as a sector when you came together in an unprecedented way to ask the Government to prioritize a truly comprehensive health and rights agenda. We listened and were able to announce the Thrive agenda last June at Women Deliver.Because of your advocacy, because of your commitment, Canada now has a 10 year strategy on global health for 2030. This means we are going to deliver SRHR services to 18 million women around the world. That is profound.I want to thank you for your fierce dedication to development. I want to thank you for your belief in a better world. I want to thank you for your continued advocacy.We will continue to need to work together, in partnership, to deliver our Feminist International Assistance Policy. To end poverty and hunger, to achieve gender equality, to foster peace, prosperity, and partnerships, and to protect the planet for today and future generations. I am excited to carry on this important endeavour with you.We count on you to share your expertise and experience. To continue to have the conversations with local leaders, health workers, and women’s groups at the community level. And to share with the government, and with me as Minister, what you have heard.My commitment to you is to continue to engage, continue to listen and learn and to be an ally and partner to reach our development objectives.But I too need your help. You have extraordinary networks of Canadians who are passionate about development. I’d like to challenge you to think creatively together as a sector about how you can leverage those networks to reach the Canadians who are compassionate, who care about the world, about our environment, fighting climate change and inequality, to share why our international development matters just as much to them.As I have said before, Canada’s international efforts need to be embraced as part of our national identity just as much as peacekeeping has become part of the Canadian identity.So, I look to all of you, to continue the extraordinarily important work you are doing, and to reach out to Canadians and talk about why development matters and why, as Canadians, we can be proud of the role we play. You are champions of the work you are doing – in health and nutrition, gender equality and empowerment, education, and so much more. Reach out to your networks. Share your stories, and please collaborate strategically on how best to communicate on the impact our work has around the world.As Prime Minister Trudeau says:“Together, we can shape a world where no one goes hungry, no one feels unsafe, and no one is left behind.”Thank you!"
367,Statement to mark International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/02/statement-to-mark-international-day-against-the-use-of-child-soldiers.html,2/12/20,2020, statements," The Honourable FrançoisPhilippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, and the Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, Minister of National Defence, today issued the following statement to mark the International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers:“Recruiting children into conflict and using them as instruments of war is a grave violation of human rights. Whether they are forced to act as messengers, porters or spies, or made to carry a weapon, involving children and youth in conflict needlessly exposes them to danger, puts their lives at immediate risk and imposes on them a psychological burden that may last forever.“Canada is proud to have introduced 17 principles focusing on preventing the recruitment and use of child soldiers by armed forces and armed groups, known as the Vancouver Principles, in 2017. Since then, 94 countries have joined Canada to address the issue of child soldiers in the context of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are thankful to the United Nations and many member states that are working to implement the Vancouver Principles.“In June 2019, the Canadian Armed Forces established the Dallaire Centre of Excellence for Peace and Security as a demonstration of Canada’s continued commitment to the Vancouver Principles. Named after LieutenantGeneral (Retired) Roméo Dallaire, a vocal advocate against the use of child soldiers, the core mandate of the centre is to support research, drawing on a diversity of expertise and perspectives from across academia and civil society to fulfill its mandate.“The International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers is an important time to restate our commitment to keeping all children out of conflict and calling for an end to all grave violations against them during armed conflict, including recruitment and sexual violence.“Canada will work with its partners all over the world to put an end to the endangerment of children.”"

Since then, every year, we take this opportunity to celebrate the vision Canadians have for a better world. “Canada has a long history of working with our international partners in helping the most vulnerable people around the world. We are committed to taking action that focuses on building a more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world for everyone. Actions like ensuring millions of children are vaccinated against illnesses like polio, supporting the transition to lowcarbon and climateresilient economies and making education a reality for thousands of girls around the world—these are just three examples of Canada’s international assistance and the important work of Canadian development organizations and workers making a difference in the lives of people around the world. “There have been notable successes in Canadian international assistance since we started marking IDW in 1991 but there remains more to do, and Canadians are committed to continue their efforts to push for a better world for everyone. This is why, as of 2015, Canada is supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs] agenda. The SDGs chart a course, telling us what remains to be done at home and abroad to get us to that better world by 2030. There are 17 SDGs, including ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, and making sure people are healthy and have access to education, water and energy.“Now, as we enter the UN decade of delivery, Canada is committed to partnering with the world to reach our goals. Which is why the theme of this year’s IDW is ‘Go for the Goals.’ This IDW is an opportunity for all Canadians to learn what Canada is doing on climate change, gender equality and health at home and abroad, and how they can contribute. “I encourage you to participate in our partner activities taking place from coast to coast to coast—in person and online. Seek out the Canadians who work and support Canada’s international assistance. Talk to them. Learn their stories. Find out how Canada has helped to change the world over the years, what we are doing today and how we will move forward as we continue to focus on delivering Agenda 2030. I hope it inspires you to get more involved in making the world a better place for everyone. It’s up to all of us to Go for the Goals.”"

This speech has been translated in accordance with the Government of Canada’s official languages policy and edited for posting and distribution in accordance with its communications policy.First and foremost, thank you for inviting me to participate in today’s conference. The topic, liberal internationalism then and now, couldn’t be more timely.As we celebrate 100 years since the birth of the original Prime Minister [Pierre Elliott] Trudeau, it is worthwhile to reflect on what has changed since his time in office and what remains the same and where Canada’s current approach to the world is going and should go.This is such an important conversation to have as we face a challenging and uncertain world. But let me lay out an argument for optimism and for being dogged in our commitment to the Canadian way.There are some in Canada who are arguing for a more realist approach to our international relations, for abandoning our steadfast commitment to the rulesbased international order and for not always playing by the rules. Nobody else does; why should we?There are those who argue we shouldn’t bother to do our part in dealing with the climate emergency. Since other countries aren’t doing their part, why should we change our way of life?In fact, we saw this approach begin to play out, denigrating the United Nations and multilateralism, picking and choosing which human rights to defend, abandoning international commitments on the fight against climate change, snubbing our nose at the very institutions we, as Canadians of all parties, worked so hard to build through the postwar era.Isolationism, populism and an inward focus are traits that haven’t been accepted by the majority of Canadians. They do not view our country’s role on the world stage as a hindrance but rather as an opportunity.As a scholar of international relations, I’ve always identified as a liberal internationalist and probably seemed at times a little naive to my more realist professors and peers. But as I take on this new role of minister of international development, I am reminded of why optimism and a commitment to a better, more connected world is a defining feature of Canada’s foreign policy.As Canadians, as citizens of a middle power, we understand too well that our own selfinterest lies in a more peaceful, stable, equitable world. The events in Iran these past few days and the tragic loss of so many fellow citizens are a stark reminder of this reality. We are not insulated from the instability in the Middle East.To achieve a more peaceful, stable, equitable world, we must go beyond diplomacy and defence and ensure a strong commitment to development. We need to start seeing development not just as a tool in our foreign policy tool kit but as a defining pillar of what we are able to achieve on the world stage.Pierre Trudeau understood this.While the idea came about under his predecessor, Prime Minister Pearson, Pierre Elliott laid the table for Canada’s emergence on the world stage as a credible, compassionate, fair and reliable partner. The creation of the Canadian International Development Agency [CIDA] and the International Development Research Council [IDRC] are two legacies of Mr. Trudeau.When I was parliamentary secretary for the minister of international development in 2016, I was at a conference in Nairobi [Kenya]. I must have met with over a dozen heads of state and foreign ministers from different African countries, and all of them, without fail, had a fond connection to CIDA, and each shared with me a story of education, health service provision, research or women’s rights advocacy that was enabled because of Canadian development assistance.Because of Canadians’ commitment to a better world, these stories continue when we meet the hundreds of former IDRC scholars and grantees around the world who are now leading their countries or international organizations.And that is the image that Canadians hold dear. It is the story we tell ourselves of our commitment to a better, more peaceful world, and it is what we are continuing to try to achieve.As minister of international development, I am confronted by the juxtaposition of the image of Canada in the postwar era, in a time of broad international cooperation among Western countries, a united front in the fight against communism and the building of a rulesbased international order with the image of Canada we want to project today, in a fractured Western world where populism and isolationism are rearing their heads in the politics of some of our closest allies.So why should we enthusiastically embrace liberal internationalism in a time of global turmoil and uncertainty? Wouldn’t we be better off retreating into our own quiet corner of the world?For me, it is a resounding no, and in fact, I think we need to double down on our efforts to project our values and work with allies and partners to protect and improve those institutions, systems and rules that ensure our collective prosperity and security.I just came from a portfolio where one of my primary responsibilities was defending our democracy against malicious foreign actors. The threats are real. We are living in a moment when worldviews are confronting each other, and our story will be shaped by how we react.This is true in the way that Jean Chrétien’s government responded in the wake of 9/11 or in the leadership and compassion of New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern following the attacks in Christchurch.Because the rulesbased international order is under threat, we, as Canadians, need to live by and lead with our values. Not just because it is the right thing to do around the world but because it is the right thing to do for Canadians.I understand that for some, this is an uncomfortable concept: placing our development work and agenda with our own selfinterest. But it is crucial for us to see it this way. Because the issues we face here at home will not be solved through diplomacy or defence alone: development is the key to unlocking these challenges.Whether it is climate change, migration and refugee flows, global health pandemics or food security [among other issues], the world is a connected place. We cannot ignore the changes on the horizon, and if we want to shape the response and we want to protect what we have here at home, we must be active players globally, particularly for development.This means building on the longstanding Canadian traditions of standing up for human rights, for justice and for democracy. For working on the hardest issues that many choose to avoid, in the toughest places, and being Canadian about it, so that we can reach those most in need.This is why I am so proud to be able to implement Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy, launched by MarieClaude Bibeau in June 2017. We are transforming the way we do development. In fact, Mark Lowcock, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, stated, in response to our genderfocused humanitarian assistance, “Canada has set a standard that many others around the world should seek to emulate.”Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy is, I believe, the single most important innovation in Canadian international cooperation since the creation of CIDA and IDRC.It forces us to tackle the root cause of poverty and instability: inequality. And it grounds our development programming in the fundamental belief that all people—regardless of gender or sexuality, race, religion or creed—have the same inalienable human rights. And that we cannot achieve the Sustainable Development Goals if we leave half the world’s population behind.Even more importantly, we cannot aspire to gender equality if we ignore sexual reproductive health and rights. A woman’s right to choose and her ability to access family planning and safe abortion services are fundamental to achieving a more equitable, more peaceful and more prosperous world.In August 2017, I took a trip to Ethiopia. I was in a small village outside of Mekele, and we stopped at the local health clinic. There were a halfdozen women there to greet us.We talked about the vaccination program and nutrition for children and how these have made significant health improvements in their community. And then the talk moved on to birth control.And one woman talked about autonomy over her body and her reproductive life. And how it transformed the power dynamics in her marriage. How she became the community health practitioner and contributed to the family income. How her husband had to respect her because she earned a good income. And, finally, how her daughter, who was 15, could see her as a role model and see that women could be selfsufficient and how her daughter was now in high school with the ambition of becoming a nurse.Sexual and reproductive health and rights not only are essential in their own right, they also serve as catalysts helping us achieve our other development goals: food security, economic development, improved health outcomes and better education.You can support women’s economic empowerment, but all the programming in the world will not make a difference if women aren’t actually participating in the economy because they can’t access child care or don’t have control over their reproductive options. And yes, that includes access to safe and legal abortion.CIDA became known around the world for its commitment to women’s rights. In 1976, they launched the first policy guidelines, in Women in Development, and in 1999 CIDA launched the Gender Equality Policy. Since 2017, we have reignited Canada’s full commitment to women’s rights globally. This is particularly exciting in 2020.This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Conference on Gender Equality and the 20th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.Sadly, we are seeing major setbacks in women’s rights and human rights around the globe. We are witnessing an increase in attacks on human rights defenders, women and LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer] activists, journalists and prodemocracy movements. Despite this, I have no intention of slowing down our commitment to human rights and women’s rights. Because as Hillary Rodham Clinton famously said in Beijing, “Women’s rights are human rights.”As you all know, the world has changed in the last 25 years, let alone the last 50 years. The way we do development has also changed. Canada needs to catch up and once again be an innovative, cuttingedge leader, doing development the right way.But the first step in crafting the Feminist International Assistance Policy was coming to terms with reality.Less than 3% of Canada’s international assistance specifically targeted gender equality, close to 30% of our programming was completely gender blind, and we spent what could be graciously described as token amounts supporting women’s rights organizations in the global south.This is what we sought to change. The policy gives us the framework to do just that.Another exciting innovation is the Equality Fund. This collective, involving the Government of Canada and feminist organizations, will leverage over $1 billion in philanthropic and genderlens investing to provide predictable and reliable funding to women’s rights organizations around the world.Until now, less than 1% of global official development assistance actually reaches women’s rights organizations. Canada is changing this by helping to build the civic space that allows new, empowering structures to be constructed.Unfortunately, it is a sad reality that there are increasingly frequent attempts to roll back the progress that has been made in relation to women’s rights and gender equality.Therefore, it is incumbent upon all of us to help protect the progress we have made and to do what we can to contribute to the empowerment and advancement of voices that have been traditionally marginalized.To do this, I need your help. It’s all well and good for us to sit here and discuss the merits and virtues of liberal internationalism and why Canada absolutely must remain committed to our international institutions, our rulesbased order and doing our part to respond to global crises, manmade or otherwise. But we have to convince Canadians that this is also the right thing to do. With populism, isolationism and individualism knocking at our door, it cannot be left to the government alone.Take, for example, the critical role that civil society played in bringing governments forward to ban landmines. This is why we believe so strongly in supporting and working with civil society organizations.I think of the pivotal leadership role that Canada played in bringing together the Global Compact for Migration, an achievement we should be incredibly proud of. Canada is a world leader in migration and refugee policy, with the creation of the World Refugee Council, which Lloyd Axworthy heads, and with the promotion of a new narrative on migrants and refugees globally.In Canada, we continue to look for those difficult issues that will make a real and tangible difference in the lives of everyday people. There are two particular things that the government did in the last mandate that stood out to me as exceptionally bold, courageous and incredibly Canadian.The unwavering support Canada provided to the White Helmets in Syria and the subsequent work to bring many of them here, and the quiet work the Government of Canada did to bring LGBTQ activists here as refugees.Canada did this because it was the right thing to do. Because we live our values and we lead on issues that other countries won’t.As a liberal internationalist and a feminist, I am proud that Canada is now a leading donor globally for gender equality and women’s rights organizations and the leading donor globally for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights. But for all you foreign policy experts in the room, I want you to think of these achievements as Canadian foreign policy achievements.So as we, Canada, look to the future and our ability to play in the world arena, we must continue to be on the vanguard of advancing human rights, upholding justice and defending democracy. We must do our part to address looming global challenges, particularly when it comes to climate change and protecting our environment, and continue to build on the vital work defending migrants and refugees the world over.Humanitarian needs are deep, and we will continue to support the poorest, the most vulnerable. We will do it, guided by our Feminist International Assistance Policy. Ensuring it is anchored in human rights and gender equality.These are complicated times we live in, absolutely. In my humble opinion, that just means we continue to pursue a more just, a more peaceful and a more prosperous world in our Canadian way, adapting to the changing landscape.I hope we can count on you not only to challenge, question and push us to be better, but also to stand with us when our values and our commitment to liberal internationalism and the rulesbased international order need to be defended.Thank you."

Yet those who remained and lived through the earthquake and reconstruction and who, today, still work hard for a better and peaceful Haiti remind us of what is good and show us that there is hope.“In the face of hardship, our two nations and our people were brought closer together than ever. Solidarity, friendships and partnerships were expressed in many ways and still are. Canadians donated an unprecedented $220 million, matched by the government of Canada. From all corners of Canada, youth, doctors, nurses, engineers and teachers volunteered their time and expertise in Haiti. And through this journey of cooperation, new ties between our communities were born.“The aftermath of the earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, is an inspiring story of commitment and compassion, and the Haitian diaspora in Canada played an important role in recovery and reconstruction efforts. Haitians who have since made Canada home have also been contributing tremendously to Canadian society, with exceptional individuals who are leaving their mark on governments, academia, industry, sports, arts and culture.“Haiti is and remains a priority country for Canada. Our development and humanitarian assistance programming in the country is ongoing, with over 50 projects currently operational, including support for maternal and newborn health, nutrition, education, and sustainable agriculture.“Today belongs to those who have lost loved ones and the bravery and resilience the Haitian people have shown against all odds.
